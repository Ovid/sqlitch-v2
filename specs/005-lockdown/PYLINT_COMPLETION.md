- Located FEATURE_DIR: `/Users/poecurt/projects/sqlitch/specs/005-lockdown`
- Identified AVAILABLE_DOCS: research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, tasks.md

### ✅ Step 2: Load Implementation Context
- **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md ✓
- **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md ✓
- **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ ✓
- **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md ✓
- **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md ✓
- **NOTE**: constitution.md does not exist at feature level (spec principles in plan.md)

### ✅ Step 3: Run and Analyze with Pylint

#### Environment Setup ✓
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Virtual environment activated
```

#### Linting Execution ✓
```bash
pylint sqlitch tests --output-format=json > pylint_report.json
```
- Exit code: 30 (issues found, as expected)
- Report saved to workspace root
- Archived to: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/pylint/pylint_report_2025-10-12.json`

#### Issue Analysis (NO FIXING) ✓

**Total Issues**: 182 (down from 286 baseline)

**Breakdown by Type**:
- Errors: 2 (both false positives, already suppressed)
- Warnings: 90 (primarily unused arguments)
- Refactor: 86 (complexity metrics)
- Convention: 4 (naming, line length)

**Top Issues by Symbol**:
1. unused-argument: 67 instances
2. too-many-arguments: 37 instances
3. too-many-locals: 18 instances
4. broad-exception-caught: 13 instances

**Score**: 9.65/10 (up from 9.29 baseline - **+3.9% improvement**)

**Test Quality**: 0 issues in tests/ directory ✓

### ✅ Step 4: Documentation and Task Updates

#### Tasks Created in tasks.md ✓
Added **Phase 3.9: Pylint Quality Improvements** with 8 tasks:

**Convention Fixes (P2):**
- T130: Fix invalid-name for `pwd` constant
- T130a: Fix line-too-long in show.py
- T130b: Document deploy.py size in TODO.md
- T130c: Fix TypeVar naming in base.py

**Warning Reduction (P2):**
- T131: Audit 67 unused arguments (target: <50)
- T134: Refine exception handling (target: <10)

**Refactor Improvements (P2):**
- T132: Reduce argument counts via dataclasses (target: <30)
- T133: Extract helpers to reduce locals (target: <15)

**Validation (P1):**
- T135: Re-run pylint after fixes (target: score ≥9.70, issues <150)
- T136: Update plan.md with final outcomes

#### Documentation Updates ✓

**research.md**:
- Added comprehensive "Pylint Analysis - Updated Baseline" section
- Documented 36% issue reduction (286 → 182)
- Detailed breakdown by type, symbol, and file
- Implementation strategy and validation protocol

**plan.md**:
- Updated Phase 1.2 status to "✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE"
- Added execution summary with key findings
- Documented progress metrics and next steps
- Confirmed constitutional compliance (no code modifications)

**PYLINT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** (new):
- Created comprehensive standalone report
- Executive summary with metrics
- Detailed analysis by issue type
- Implementation strategy with time estimates
- Success criteria and validation commands
- Complete appendices with references

### ✅ Step 5: Progress Tracking and Reporting

#### Progress Reported ✓
- Analysis completed systematically by issue type
- Each major category documented with context
- No deep architectural flaws identified
- Score confirms strong baseline quality

#### Pylint Score ✓
```
Your code has been rated at 9.65/10
```
- Previous baseline: 9.29/10
- Current score: 9.65/10
- Improvement: +0.36 points (+3.9%)

#### Risks Noted ✓
No significant technical risks identified:
- 2 error-level issues are false positives (already suppressed)
- All remaining issues are quality improvements
- No blocking issues for release
- Test code is 100% clean (0 issues)

### ✅ Step 6: Completion Validation

#### All Issues Documented ✓
- 182 issues categorized and analyzed
- Each category has corresponding task in tasks.md
- Priorities assigned based on impact
- Deferred items documented in TODO.md

#### Specs/Plan/Tasks Consistency ✓
- plan.md Phase 1.2 marked complete
- research.md updated with detailed analysis
- tasks.md Phase 3.9 added with structured tasks
- All documents cross-reference each other

#### Summary Report ✓
