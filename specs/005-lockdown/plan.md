9. ‚èπÔ∏è Ready for `/tasks` execution once this plan is approved.

## Summary
The lockdown feature prepares SQLitch for a stable 1.0 release by driving coverage, documentation, and security to the constitutional bar while proving Sqitch parity through new UAT compatibility scripts. Work emphasizes tightening existing modules (`config/resolver`, `registry/state`, `utils/identity`), codifying documentation and manual gates, and introducing forward/backward compatibility scripts that reuse the SQLite tutorial workflow. All compatibility validation remains manual via the release checklist, with evidence captured in release PR comments.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: Click (CLI), sqlite3, pytest/pytest-randomly, pip-audit, bandit  
**Storage**: Tutorial SQLite databases (`flipr_test.db`, `flipr_prod.db`, `dev/flipr.db`), Sqitch/SQLitch registry databases  
**Testing**: pytest (unit/integration/golden), click.testing `CliRunner`, manual UAT harnesses under `uat/`  
**Target Platform**: macOS & Linux command-line environments  
**Project Type**: Single CLI + library repository  
**Constraints**: Maintain ‚â•90% coverage, pass mypy --strict, document manual UAT runs, no new feature work during lockdown  
**Scale/Scope**: Sqitch tutorial workflow, existing config/plan/engine modules, release preparations for v1.0.0

## Constitution Check
- **Test-First Development**: Future task list will ensure failing tests precede fixes (coverage, docstrings, UAT harness regression tests).
- **Observability & Determinism**: Compatibility scripts keep human-readable output and sanitize timestamps/SHA1s without emitting structured logs.
- **Behavioral Parity**: All compatibility flows strictly follow `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`; deviations must be documented with rationale.
- **Simplicity-First**: Reuse and extract helpers from `uat/side-by-side.py` rather than rewrite logic; defer multi-engine support.
- **Documented Interfaces**: Plan mandates docstring coverage, README/CONTRIBUTING updates, and release checklist documentation.
- **Sqitch Implementation as Source of Truth**: All behavior must be verified against Sqitch's implementation in the `sqitch/` directory. This includes syntax support (e.g., `@HEAD^`), error handling, and edge cases.

Result: ‚úÖ Initial constitution gate passes; no complexity exemptions required.

### üéØ Critical Principle: Sqitch Behavioral Parity
**All SQLitch implementation work MUST verify behavior against the Perl Sqitch codebase in `sqitch/`.**

This constitutional requirement means:
- Before implementing features: Consult `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/` for canonical behavior
- During implementation: Match Sqitch's handling of syntax, options, edge cases, and error paths
- During testing: Verify against actual Sqitch behavior, not documentation alone
- When behavioral differences are found: Update SQLitch to match (document any intentional deviations)

This principle applies to lockdown work and all future development.

**Structure Decision**: Single Python CLI/library repository; enhancements span `sqlitch/*`, `tests/*`, `uat/`, and documentation assets.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Captured clarifications on UAT scope (SQLite-only), manual execution cadence, and evidence capture in [`research.md`](./research.md).
- Summarized baseline coverage metrics and target modules from `BASELINE_ASSESSMENT.md`.
- Identified helper extraction strategy (sanitization/comparison/test steps) to minimize duplication across UAT scripts.

Deliverable: Research doc complete ‚úÖ

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Documented operational artifacts and planned helper modules in [`data-model.md`](./data-model.md); no schema changes required.
- Defined CLI contract expectations for compatibility scripts in [`contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md`](./contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md).
- Authored [`quickstart.md`](./quickstart.md) covering setup, quality gates, manual UAT execution, and release PR comment template.
- Confirmed that future test work will add failing tests for coverage gaps, docstrings, security scans, and new UAT harness behaviours before implementation.

Post-design constitution check: ‚úÖ unchanged (still compliant).

## Phase 1.1: Quality Signal Follow-Up (2025-10-12)
- Recorded fresh gate results (pytest ‚úÖ, coverage 91.39%) exposing three regression areas:
  - **Type Safety**: `mypy` currently reports 70 errors concentrated in `sqlitch/cli/commands/{target,deploy,rework,...}`; requires coordinated refactor plus regression guard to keep `mypy --strict` in CI.
  - **Linting**: `flake8` reports 73 violations (line length, unused imports, duplicate helpers) led by `sqlitch/registry/migrations.py`; plan includes trimming lines, removing unused imports, and consolidating helper definitions.
  - **Security**: `bandit` flags SHA1 usage in `sqlitch/utils/identity.py`; mitigation is to mark `usedforsecurity=False` while keeping Sqitch-compatible change IDs.
- Action: escalate these items into Phase 3 tasks (see new T120‚ÄìT123) and document black/mypy regression tests to ensure future runs fail fast.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (preview)
- `/tasks` will transform design artifacts into actionable steps:
  - Coverage and docstring gaps ‚Üí failing tests then fixes per module.
  - Security gates ‚Üí scripted checks plus remediation tasks.
  - UAT scripts ‚Üí shared helper extraction, forward/backward script implementation, manual checklist updates, evidence-review tasks.
  - **UAT Validation Protocol**: Before testing sqlitch parity, verify sqitch behavior matches tutorial expectations from `uat/sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`.
- Tasks remain grouped by phase (Assessment, Coverage, Documentation, Stability, Security, UAT Validation) with P1 priority for constitutional gates and manual UAT deliverables.

## Critical Discovery (2025-10-11)

### UAT Script Validation Issue (Resolved)
**UAT Script Validation Issue Identified**: During execution of T060b, discovered that `uat/side-by-side.py` step 30 fails because the script removes test directories without preserving essential project files (`sqitch.conf`, `sqitch.plan`). This revealed a fundamental flaw in the UAT validation approach:

**Problem**: The UAT script was testing "sqlitch vs sqitch" without first verifying that sqitch behavior itself matches the tutorial expectations from `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`.

**Impact**: When step 30 (`sqitch deploy db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db`) produced "Plan file sqitch.plan does not exist", we discovered the UAT script's test setup doesn't match the tutorial workflow. According to the tutorial, this command should produce:
```
Adding registry tables to db:sqlite:dev/sqitch.db
Deploying changes to db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db
  + users ................... ok
  + flips ................... ok
```

**Root Cause**: UAT script removes working directories between test phases without recreating the project context that the tutorial assumes.

**Resolution**: Added new task T060b2 to establish a validation protocol:
1. Before running any UAT comparison, verify each test step against corresponding tutorial section
2. Ensure UAT script setup (files, directories, context) matches tutorial prerequisites  
3. Validate that sqitch produces tutorial-expected output at every step FIRST
4. Only after sqitch behavior is verified correct, proceed to test sqlitch parity

This discovery reinforces the constitutional principle: **Sqitch implementation is the source of truth**, and the tutorial documents expected behavior. UAT scripts must validate against both.

### Missing Rework Support (BLOCKING - 2025-10-11)

**Critical Missing Feature Identified**: During UAT execution at step 39 (`sqitch rework userflips`), discovered that SQLitch's plan parser does not support **reworked changes** - a core Sqitch feature that allows the same change name to appear multiple times in the plan with different versions.

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION**: This is a fundamental behavioral parity gap. Sqitch explicitly allows and expects reworked changes via the `sqitch rework` command.

**Sqitch's Rework Behavior** (verified in `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm`):
- Allows duplicate change names in plan files
- Uses tag dependency syntax to mark rework versions: `change_name [change_name@tag_name]`
- Example from tutorial step 39: `userflips [userflips@v1.0.0-dev2]` creates a new version of userflips
- Maintains rework chains via `add_rework_tags` method
- Uses `@HEAD` suffix internally to track latest version

**SQLitch's Current Behavior**:
- Plan parser explicitly rejects duplicate change names in `Plan.__post_init__`
- Raises `ValueError: Plan contains duplicate change name: userflips`
- Cannot parse plans created by `sqitch rework` command

**Impact**:
- UAT execution blocked at step 39 (cannot parse plan after `sqitch rework userflips`)
- Steps 39-46 cannot be tested without this feature
- Forward/backward compatibility testing blocked
- Cannot claim Sqitch parity without rework support

**Required Implementation** (Task T067):
1. Remove duplicate name validation from `Plan.__post_init__`
2. Add rework relationship tracking to `Change` model
3. Update plan parser to handle rework syntax
4. Implement `@HEAD` version tracking for changes
5. Update symbolic resolution to use latest version by default
6. Add comprehensive rework tests

**Blocking Tasks**: T060b (side-by-side UAT), T060c-T060f (forward/backward compat)

**Priority**: P1 - CRITICAL - Must be implemented before lockdown can proceed
