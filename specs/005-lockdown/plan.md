# Implementation Plan: Quality Lockdown and Stabilization

**Branch**: `005-lockdown` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 (Updated) | **Spec**: [`spec.md`](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-lockdown/spec.md`  
**Target**: Alpha release (NOT v1.0.0 - this is still alpha software)

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
1. ‚úÖ Loaded feature specification from `/specs/005-lockdown/spec.md` and processed clarifications.
2. ‚úÖ Populated Technical Context using repository conventions (Python 3.11 CLI app).
3. ‚úÖ Reviewed Constitution v1.10.1 for mandatory principles.
4. ‚úÖ Documented initial constitution check (no violations detected).
5. ‚úÖ Recorded Phase 0 research notes in [`research.md`](./research.md).
6. ‚úÖ Generated Phase 1 design artifacts (`data-model.md`, `contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md`, `quickstart.md`).
7. ‚úÖ Re-ran constitution check after design (still compliant).
8. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Phase 2 task planning will run under `/tasks`.
9. ‚èπÔ∏è Ready for `/tasks` execution once this plan is approved.

## Summary
The lockdown feature prepares SQLitch for a stable **alpha release** by driving coverage, documentation, and security to the constitutional bar while proving Sqitch parity through new UAT compatibility scripts. Work emphasizes tightening existing modules (`config/resolver`, `registry/state`, `utils/identity`), codifying documentation and manual gates, and introducing forward/backward compatibility scripts that reuse the SQLite tutorial workflow. All compatibility validation remains manual via the release checklist, with evidence captured in release PR comments.

**Important**: This is NOT a v1.0.0 release. SQLitch remains alpha software requiring additional validation and real-world usage before production readiness.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: Click (CLI), sqlite3, pytest/pytest-randomly, pip-audit, bandit  
**Storage**: Tutorial SQLite databases (`flipr_test.db`, `flipr_prod.db`, `dev/flipr.db`), Sqitch/SQLitch registry databases  
**Testing**: pytest (unit/integration/golden), click.testing `CliRunner`, manual UAT harnesses under `uat/`  
**Target Platform**: macOS & Linux command-line environments  
**Project Type**: Single CLI + library repository  
**Constraints**: Maintain ‚â•90% coverage, pass mypy --strict, document manual UAT runs, no new feature work during lockdown, pylint analysis required  
**Scale/Scope**: Sqitch tutorial workflow, existing config/plan/engine modules, release preparations for alpha release (NOT v1.0.0)

## Constitution Check
- **Test-First Development**: Future task list will ensure failing tests precede fixes (coverage, docstrings, UAT harness regression tests).
- **Observability & Determinism**: Compatibility scripts keep human-readable output and sanitize timestamps/SHA1s without emitting structured logs.
- **Behavioral Parity**: All compatibility flows strictly follow `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`; deviations must be documented with rationale.
- **Simplicity-First**: Reuse and extract helpers from `uat/side-by-side.py` rather than rewrite logic; defer multi-engine support.
- **Documented Interfaces**: Plan mandates docstring coverage, README/CONTRIBUTING updates, and release checklist documentation.
- **Sqitch Implementation as Source of Truth**: All behavior must be verified against Sqitch's implementation in the `sqitch/` directory. This includes syntax support (e.g., `@HEAD^`), error handling, and edge cases.

Result: ‚úÖ Initial constitution gate passes; no complexity exemptions required.

### üéØ Critical Principle: Sqitch Behavioral Parity
**All SQLitch implementation work MUST verify behavior against the Perl Sqitch codebase in `sqitch/`.**

This constitutional requirement means:
- Before implementing features: Consult `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/` for canonical behavior
- During implementation: Match Sqitch's handling of syntax, options, edge cases, and error paths
- During testing: Verify against actual Sqitch behavior, not documentation alone
- When behavioral differences are found: Update SQLitch to match (document any intentional deviations)

This principle applies to lockdown work and all future development.

**Structure Decision**: Single Python CLI/library repository; enhancements span `sqlitch/*`, `tests/*`, `uat/`, and documentation assets.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Captured clarifications on UAT scope (SQLite-only), manual execution cadence, and evidence capture in [`research.md`](./research.md).
- Summarized baseline coverage metrics and target modules from `BASELINE_ASSESSMENT.md`.
- Identified helper extraction strategy (sanitization/comparison/test steps) to minimize duplication across UAT scripts.

Deliverable: Research doc complete ‚úÖ

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Documented operational artifacts and planned helper modules in [`data-model.md`](./data-model.md); no schema changes required.
- Defined CLI contract expectations for compatibility scripts in [`contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md`](./contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md).
- Authored [`quickstart.md`](./quickstart.md) covering setup, quality gates, manual UAT execution, and release PR comment template.
- Confirmed that future test work will add failing tests for coverage gaps, docstrings, security scans, and new UAT harness behaviours before implementation.

Post-design constitution check: ‚úÖ unchanged (still compliant).

## Phase 1.1: Quality Signal Follow-Up (2025-10-12)
- Recorded fresh gate results (pytest ‚úÖ, coverage 91.39%) exposing three regression areas:
  - **Type Safety**: `mypy` currently reports 70 errors concentrated in `sqlitch/cli/commands/{target,deploy,rework,...}`; requires coordinated refactor plus regression guard to keep `mypy --strict` in CI.
  - **Linting**: `flake8` reports 73 violations (line length, unused imports, duplicate helpers) led by `sqlitch/registry/migrations.py`; plan includes trimming lines, removing unused imports, and consolidating helper definitions.
  - **Security**: `bandit` flags SHA1 usage in `sqlitch/utils/identity.py`; mitigation is to mark `usedforsecurity=False` while keeping Sqitch-compatible change IDs.
- Action: escalate these items into Phase 3 tasks (see new T120‚ÄìT123) and document black/mypy regression tests to ensure future runs fail fast.

## Phase 1.2: Pylint Analysis Workflow (2025-10-12)
**Objective**: Use pylint as an additional code quality tool to systematically identify and address code issues.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ANALYSIS COMPLETE - CONVENTION FIXES APPLIED** (2025-10-12)

### Execution Summary

1. **Baseline Report Generated**: ‚úÖ
   ```bash
   pylint sqlitch tests --output-format=json > pylint_report.json
   ```
   - Report saved to workspace root
   - 182 total issues identified
   - Score: **9.65/10** (excellent baseline)

   - Categorized by type: errors (2), warnings (90), refactor (86), convention (4)
   - Identified top issue symbols and file hotspots
   - **Key Finding**: 0 issues in test files (tests/ directory 100% clean)

3. **Tasks Created in tasks.md**: ‚úÖ
   - **Phase 3.9** added with 10 tasks (T130-T136)
   - Tasks categorized by issue type:

   - Each task includes file locations, validation commands, and success targets

4. **Convention Fixes Applied**: ‚úÖ (2025-10-12)
   - T130: `pwd` module import in `identity.py` - Added suppression with justification
   - T130a: Long line in `show.py:198` - Added suppression (readability priority)
   - T130b: Large module `deploy.py` - Documented refactoring plan in TODO.md
   - T130c: TypeVar naming in `base.py` - Added suppression (PEP 484 compliant)
   - **Result**: Convention issues reduced from 4 to 1 (75% reduction)

5. **Final Validation Completed**: ‚úÖ (2025-10-12)
   - Score: **9.66/10** (up from 9.65 - **+0.01 improvement**)
   - Total issues: **179** (down from 182 - **2% reduction**)

6. **Documentation Updated in research.md**: ‚úÖ
   - Added comprehensive final pylint results section
   - Documented decision to defer T131-T134 (code quality improvements)
   - **Rationale for Deferral**:
     - High risk of breaking tests for P2 priority improvements
     - Current score 9.66/10 acceptable for alpha release
     - Constitutional principle: Don't break tests for non-critical changes
     - Better suited for post-alpha when behavioral contracts proven in production

### Final Pylint Outcomes

**Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Convention fixes completed successfully (4 ‚Üí 1 issues, 75% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Pylint score improved: 9.65 ‚Üí 9.66 (+0.01)
- ‚úÖ Total issue reduction: 182 ‚Üí 179 (2% decrease)
- ‚úÖ Zero regressions introduced
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (constitutional requirement maintained)

**Deferred Issues** (P2 Priority - Post-Alpha):
- T131: 67 unused argument warnings (primarily Click-injected params)
- T132: 37 functions with excessive arguments (refactoring required)
- T133: 18 functions with too many locals (complexity improvements)
- T134: 13 broad exception handlers (error handling patterns)

**Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úÖ
- Code quality work did not break any existing tests
- Behavioral parity maintained
- Low-risk improvements applied, high-risk improvements documented for future work
- Satisfies quality gate expectations for alpha release

**Conclusion**: Pylint gate meets constitutional requirements for lockdown milestone. Score of 9.66/10 with 179 issues (mostly code complexity patterns) is acceptable for alpha release. Remaining P2 improvements documented in TODO.md for post-alpha iteration.

### Next Steps

Execute Phase 3.9 tasks (T130-T136) in the following order:
1. T130 series: Quick convention fixes (P2)
2. T131-T134: Systematic issue reduction by category (P2)
3. T135: Validation run after fixes (P1)
4. T136: Final documentation update (P1)

**Note**: Phase 3.9 execution deferred until after core lockdown tasks complete (T060-T066). Pylint improvements are quality enhancements, not blockers for release.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (preview)
- `/tasks` will transform design artifacts into actionable steps:
  - Coverage and docstring gaps ‚Üí failing tests then fixes per module.
  - Security gates ‚Üí scripted checks plus remediation tasks.
  - UAT scripts ‚Üí shared helper extraction, forward/backward script implementation, manual checklist updates, evidence-review tasks.
  - **UAT Validation Protocol**: Before testing sqlitch parity, verify sqitch behavior matches tutorial expectations from `uat/sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`.
- Tasks remain grouped by phase (Assessment, Coverage, Documentation, Stability, Security, UAT Validation) with P1 priority for constitutional gates and manual UAT deliverables.

## Critical Discovery (2025-10-11)

### UAT Script Validation Issue (Resolved)
**UAT Script Validation Issue Identified**: During execution of T060b, discovered that `uat/side-by-side.py` step 30 fails because the script removes test directories without preserving essential project files (`sqitch.conf`, `sqitch.plan`). This revealed a fundamental flaw in the UAT validation approach:

**Problem**: The UAT script was testing "sqlitch vs sqitch" without first verifying that sqitch behavior itself matches the tutorial expectations from `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod`.

**Impact**: When step 30 (`sqitch deploy db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db`) produced "Plan file sqitch.plan does not exist", we discovered the UAT script's test setup doesn't match the tutorial workflow. According to the tutorial, this command should produce:
```
Adding registry tables to db:sqlite:dev/sqitch.db
Deploying changes to db:sqlite:dev/flipr.db
  + users ................... ok
  + flips ................... ok
```

**Root Cause**: UAT script removes working directories between test phases without recreating the project context that the tutorial assumes.

**Resolution**: Added new task T060b2 to establish a validation protocol:
1. Before running any UAT comparison, verify each test step against corresponding tutorial section
2. Ensure UAT script setup (files, directories, context) matches tutorial prerequisites  
3. Validate that sqitch produces tutorial-expected output at every step FIRST
4. Only after sqitch behavior is verified correct, proceed to test sqlitch parity

This discovery reinforces the constitutional principle: **Sqitch implementation is the source of truth**, and the tutorial documents expected behavior. UAT scripts must validate against both.

### Missing Rework Support (BLOCKING - 2025-10-11)

**Critical Missing Feature Identified**: During UAT execution at step 39 (`sqitch rework userflips`), discovered that SQLitch's plan parser does not support **reworked changes** - a core Sqitch feature that allows the same change name to appear multiple times in the plan with different versions.

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION**: This is a fundamental behavioral parity gap. Sqitch explicitly allows and expects reworked changes via the `sqitch rework` command.

**Sqitch's Rework Behavior** (verified in `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm`):
- Allows duplicate change names in plan files
- Uses tag dependency syntax to mark rework versions: `change_name [change_name@tag_name]`
- Example from tutorial step 39: `userflips [userflips@v1.0.0-dev2]` creates a new version of userflips
- Maintains rework chains via `add_rework_tags` method
- Uses `@HEAD` suffix internally to track latest version

**SQLitch's Current Behavior**:
- Plan parser explicitly rejects duplicate change names in `Plan.__post_init__`
- Raises `ValueError: Plan contains duplicate change name: userflips`
- Cannot parse plans created by `sqitch rework` command

**Impact**:
- UAT execution blocked at step 39 (cannot parse plan after `sqitch rework userflips`)
- Steps 39-46 cannot be tested without this feature
- Forward/backward compatibility testing blocked
- Cannot claim Sqitch parity without rework support

**Required Implementation** (Task T067):
1. Remove duplicate name validation from `Plan.__post_init__`
2. Add rework relationship tracking to `Change` model
3. Update plan parser to handle rework syntax
4. Implement `@HEAD` version tracking for changes
5. Update symbolic resolution to use latest version by default
6. Add comprehensive rework tests

**Blocking Tasks**: T060b (side-by-side UAT), T060c-T060f (forward/backward compat)

**Priority**: P1 - CRITICAL - Must be implemented before lockdown can proceed
