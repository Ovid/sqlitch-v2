## Dependencies

**Blocking Chain**:
- Phase 1 (Assessment) must complete before prioritizing work
- Phase 2-6 can proceed in parallel once assessment done
- Phase 7 (Validation) requires all previous phases complete

**Parallel Execution**:
- Coverage improvements (L020-L034) can proceed independently
- Documentation (L040-L058) can proceed independently
- Bug fixes (L060-L073) can proceed as discovered
- Security audit (L080-L093) can proceed independently
- Performance profiling (L100-L113) can proceed independently

4. âœ… Zero critical security vulnerabilities
5. âœ… All CLI commands have contract tests
6. âœ… All error paths tested
7. âœ… Performance benchmarks documented
8. âœ… README and CONTRIBUTING.md complete

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Scope creep from feature requests  
**Mitigation**: Strict no-new-features policy. Document requests for post-1.0.

**Risk**: Coverage requirements too strict  
**Mitigation**: Allow documented exceptions for untestable code.

**Risk**: Timeline overruns  
**Mitigation**: Focus P1 tasks first, defer P3/P4 to post-1.0 if needed.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10  
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocks v1.0.0 release  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
