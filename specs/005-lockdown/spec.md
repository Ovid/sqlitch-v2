## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: Which environments must the new compatibility scripts exercise to count as "complete"? â†’ A: Only the existing SQLite tutorial workflow
- Q: How should the three compatibility scripts integrate into our workflows once implemented? â†’ A: Manual runs only (documented checklist)
- Q: Where must results from each manual UAT run be recorded? â†’ A: Post a comment in the release pull request summarizing the outcomes

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: What pylint score threshold should `tox -e lint` enforce before the gate passes? â†’ A: Fail below 9.00

## âš¡ Quick Guidelines
- **NO new features** - Only bug fixes, tests, documentation, and stability improvements
- Achieve and maintain â‰¥90% test coverage across all modules
- All public APIs MUST have comprehensive docstrings
- All configuration behavior MUST be tested
- All error paths MUST be tested
- All CLI commands MUST have contract tests
- **UAT compatibility tests MUST pass** - Side-by-side, forward, and backward compatibility
- Security audit MUST pass
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Principle: Sqitch Behavioral Parity
**All SQLitch behavior MUST align with Sqitch behavior as implemented in the vendored `sqitch/` directory.**

This means:
- When implementing or fixing features, **consult the Perl Sqitch codebase in `sqitch/`** as the source of truth
- Syntax and features that work in Sqitch (e.g., `@HEAD^`, `@ROOT`, symbolic references) MUST work identically in SQLitch
- Edge cases, error messages, and command-line option handling should mirror Sqitch's behavior
- When behavioral differences are discovered, SQLitch must be updated to match Sqitch (unless there's a documented security or correctness issue in Sqitch)
- All test scenarios should verify behavior against Sqitch's implementation, not assumptions

**Implementation Workflow**:
1. Before implementing any command or feature: Review corresponding Sqitch code in `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/` 
2. Document Sqitch's behavior (including edge cases, error paths, special syntax)
3. Implement SQLitch to match that behavior
4. Verify with UAT scripts and/or manual testing against actual Sqitch
5. Document any intentional deviations with clear rationale

This principle applies to ALL future work, not just lockdown tasks.

## Objectives

### 1. Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve â‰¥90% coverage in all modules
- **Type Safety**: Eliminate the current 70-error mypy backlog and keep `mypy --strict` green; add an automated guard (pytest or tox) that fails when mypy regresses.
- **Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public APIs
- **Code Style**: Enforce consistent formatting (Black, isort) and ensure linting (flake8) runs clean via an automated check.
- **Formatting Gates**: Add regression tests/automation that assert `black --check` and `isort --check-only` remain compliant.
- **Pylint Remediation**: Use pylint as an enforceable gate, not just an informational report:
  - Generate and continuously update pylint reports: `pylint sqlitch tests --output-format=json > pylint_report.json`
  - Resolve every `fatal` and `error` item; suppressions require explicit justification in-code and in the implementation report.
  - Reduce or document `warning`, `refactor`, and `convention` findings with assigned follow-up tasks and deadlines.
  - Add an automated guard (tox or pytest) that fails when pylint introduces new `fatal`/`error` entries or the score drops below **9.00**.
  - Target: Zero unhandled pylint errors with remediation evidence captured alongside other quality gates.

### 2. Stability
- **Bug Fixes**: Address all known bugs and edge cases
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Test and handle boundary conditions
- **Regression Protection**: Ensure no regressions from features 001-004

### 3. Security
- **Input Validation**: Audit all user inputs for injection risks
- **File Operations**: Audit file handling for path traversal
- **Configuration**: Audit config parsing for security issues
- **Dependencies**: Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- **Hashing**: Update any Git-compatible SHA1 usage (e.g., `utils/identity.generate_change_id`) to pass Bandit by marking `usedforsecurity=False` while retaining Sqitch parity.

### 4. User Experience
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive --help output for all commands
- **Examples**: Add usage examples to documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

### 5. UAT Compatibility Testing
- **Scope**: All compatibility scripts validate the SQLite tutorial workflow only; other engines remain out of scope for lockdown.
- **Halt State Protocol**: UAT execution tasks follow an incremental debugging workflow. Each script failure triggers: HALT â†’ identify root cause â†’ implement minimal fix â†’ run tests â†’ commit â†’ END SESSION. This prevents context overflow and ensures each fix is reviewed independently. See [`UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`](./UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) for detailed protocols.
- **Side-by-Side Testing**: `uat/side-by-side.py` validates functional equivalence between sqitch and sqlitch
  - Follows `sqitch/lib/sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod` tutorial steps
  - Compares command output (semantically equivalent, minor formatting differences acceptable)
  - Validates user-visible database state (ignores registry metadata)
  - Sanitizes timestamps and SHA1s for comparison
  - Halts on behavioral differences (not cosmetic output differences)
- **Forward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqlitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqitch as next command
  - Ensures sqlitch â†’ sqitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqitch can continue from sqlitch state
  - Tests production scenario: users can switch to sqlitch without lock-in
- **Backward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqlitch as next command
  - Ensures sqitch â†’ sqlitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqlitch can continue from sqitch state
  - Tests migration scenario: users can adopt sqlitch from existing sqitch projects
- **Execution Expectation**: All three scripts run as part of the documented release checklist; CI integration is optional.
- **Evidence**: Each manual run must be summarized in a comment on the release pull request with links to sanitized logs.

### 6. Test Safety
- `tests/support/test_helpers.py` MUST, on import, delete every environment variable used by Sqitch or SQLitch (e.g., `SQITCH_*`, `SQLITCH_*`, `SQLITCH_CONFIG`, `SQLITCH_TARGET`) to guarantee tests never read or write user/system configuration outside the isolated workspace. This requirement is critical for constitutional test isolation compliance.

## Success Criteria

**Note**: See [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) for the canonical task tracking and completion status. The criteria below define the quality bar; tasks.md tracks progress toward meeting them.

### Quality Gates
- Test coverage â‰¥90% in all modules
- All public functions have docstrings
- mypy --strict passes with zero errors
- Black and isort formatting enforced with automated regression tests
- flake8 linting passes with zero violations (no ignored errors)
- Pylint remediation complete and enforced via automation:
  - No remaining `fatal` or `error` diagnostics; any suppression is documented with rationale in code and in `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_LOCKDOWN.md`.
  - Warnings/refactors either resolved or tracked with dated follow-up tasks and ownership in `tasks.md`.
  - Lint gate (`tox -e lint` or equivalent) runs in CI and fails the build on new pylint regressions or score < **9.00**.
- `tests/support/test_helpers.py` is validated to clear Sqitch/SQLitch environment variables before any helper logic executes, ensuring tests run against a sanitized environment.
- All TODO comments addressed or ticketed

### Functional Gates

## Implementation Details

### UAT Compatibility Scripts

#### 1. Side-by-Side Test (`uat/side-by-side.py`)
**Status**: âœ… Implemented

Tests functional equivalence by running both tools in parallel:
- Runs each tutorial step with both sqitch and sqlitch
- Compares sanitized output (masks SHA1s, timestamps)
- Compares user-visible database state (ignores sqitch registry)
- Continues on failure with `--continue` flag
- Can ignore specific steps with `--ignore` flag
- Outputs comprehensive logs to `sqitch.log` and `sqlitch.log`

**Usage**:
```bash
./uat/side-by-side.py                    # Run full test
./uat/side-by-side.py --continue         # Continue on failures
./uat/side-by-side.py --out results.txt  # Save output to file
./uat/side-by-side.py --ignore 5 10      # Ignore steps 5 and 10
```

#### 2. Forward Compatibility Test (`uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`)
**Status**: âœ… Implemented and validated (T060c, T060d complete â€” 46/46 steps green on 2025-10-11)

Tests sqlitch â†’ sqitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqlitch
- Run step N+1 with sqitch
- Validate sqitch successfully continues from sqlitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps (all steps pass; final log stored at `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/forward-compat-final.log`)

**Key Validations**:
- Sqitch reads sqlitch registry correctly
- Sqitch handles sqlitch-deployed changes
- Sqitch verify works on sqlitch deployments
- Sqitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Execution Notes**:
- Shares sanitization helpers with the side-by-side harness
- Alternates tools through the full tutorial sequence and compares end-state parity
- Logs both tools' operations; sanitized transcript archived with the release evidence
- Tested with both tagged and untagged changes, including rework scenarios unlocked by T067
- Documented in the release checklist and PR evidence template (see `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_LOCKDOWN.md`)

**Follow-Up**: Continue running as part of the release checklist; only rerun implementation work if UAT uncovers regressions.

#### 3. Backward Compatibility Test (`uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`)
**Status**: âœ… Implemented and validated (T060e, T060f complete â€” 46/46 steps green on 2025-10-11)

Tests sqitch â†’ sqlitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqitch
- Run step N+1 with sqlitch
- Validate sqlitch successfully continues from sqitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps (all steps pass; final log stored at `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/backward-compat-final.log`)

**Key Validations**:
- Sqlitch reads sqitch registry correctly
- Sqlitch handles sqitch-deployed changes
- Sqlitch verify works on sqitch deployments
- Sqlitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Execution Notes**:
- Shares sanitization helpers with the side-by-side harness
- Alternates tools through the full tutorial sequence and confirms SQLitch resume capability
- Logs both tools' operations; sanitized transcript archived with the release evidence
- Covers tagged/untagged changes and rework flows now supported by T067
- Documented in the release checklist and PR evidence template (see `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_LOCKDOWN.md`)

**Follow-Up**: Keep in the manual release gate; investigate and remediate if future runs regress.

#### Shared Infrastructure
All three scripts should share:
- Common sanitization functions (SHA1, timestamps)
- Database comparison utilities (user tables only)
- Logging and output formatting
- Test step definitions (from tutorial)
- Cleanup and error handling

**Directory Structure**:
```
uat/
  __init__.py                      # âœ… Shared package init
  side-by-side.py                  # âœ… Fully implemented

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Scope creep from "just one more feature"  
**Mitigation**: Strict no-new-features policy. Any feature requests get ticketed for post-lockdown.

**Risk**: Test coverage requirements delay release  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize high-value modules first. Allow exemptions with documented rationale.

**Risk**: Security issues found late in process  
**Mitigation**: Security audit early in lockdown phase.

**Risk**: UAT scripts may have false positives from output formatting differences  
**Mitigation**: Sophisticated sanitization (timestamps, SHA1s). Document acceptable cosmetic differences. Focus on behavioral equivalence, not byte-for-byte output matching.

**Risk**: Compatibility testing may reveal deep architectural incompatibilities  
**Mitigation**: Run UAT tests early in lockdown phase. Registry format is already aligned with sqitch. Most compatibility issues should surface in side-by-side testing first.

**Risk**: Tutorial steps may change between sqitch versions  
**Mitigation**: UAT testing validates against **Sqitch v1.5.3** (vendored in `sqitch/` directory). Update UAT scripts when upgrading to new Sqitch versions.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12  
**Priority**: HIGH - Prepare for alpha release (NOT v1.0.0)  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks

**Note**: This lockdown prepares SQLitch for a stable **alpha release**, not v1.0.0. The software is still in alpha stage and requires additional validation and real-world usage before declaring production readiness.
