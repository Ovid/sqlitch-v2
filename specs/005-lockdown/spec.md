## âš¡ Quick Guidelines
- **NO new features** - Only bug fixes, tests, documentation, and stability improvements
- Achieve and maintain â‰¥90% test coverage across all modules
- All public APIs MUST have comprehensive docstrings
- All configuration behavior MUST be tested
- All error paths MUST be tested
- All CLI commands MUST have contract tests
- **UAT compatibility tests MUST pass** - Side-by-side, forward, and backward compatibility
- Security audit MUST pass
- Performance profiling MUST identify no critical bottlenecks
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate

---

## Objectives

### 1. Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve â‰¥90% coverage in all modules
- **Type Safety**: Add missing type hints, pass mypy --strict
- **Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public APIs
- **Code Style**: Enforce consistent formatting (Black, isort)

### 2. Stability
- **Bug Fixes**: Address all known bugs and edge cases
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Test and handle boundary conditions
- **Regression Protection**: Ensure no regressions from features 001-004

### 3. Security
- **Input Validation**: Audit all user inputs for injection risks
- **File Operations**: Audit file handling for path traversal
- **Configuration**: Audit config parsing for security issues
- **Dependencies**: Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### 4. Performance
- **Profiling**: Profile common operations
- **Optimization**: Address performance bottlenecks
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and file handle usage
- **Scalability**: Test with large plan files and many changes

### 5. User Experience
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive --help output for all commands
- **Examples**: Add usage examples to documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

### 6. UAT Compatibility Testing
- **Side-by-Side Testing**: `uat/side-by-side.py` validates functional equivalence between sqitch and sqlitch
  - Follows `sqitch/lib/sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod` tutorial steps
  - Compares command output (semantically equivalent, minor formatting differences acceptable)
  - Validates user-visible database state (ignores registry metadata)
  - Sanitizes timestamps and SHA1s for comparison
  - Halts on behavioral differences (not cosmetic output differences)
- **Forward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqlitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqitch as next command
  - Ensures sqlitch â†’ sqitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqitch can continue from sqlitch state
  - Tests production scenario: users can switch to sqlitch without lock-in
- **Backward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqlitch as next command
  - Ensures sqitch â†’ sqlitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqlitch can continue from sqitch state
  - Tests migration scenario: users can adopt sqlitch from existing sqitch projects

## Non-Goals

- **New Features**: No new functionality added in this phase
- **API Changes**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Refactoring**: Only refactor if it improves quality/testability
- **Performance Optimization**: Only if critical issues found

---

## Constitutional Compliance

This feature directly supports:
- **Constitution I: Test-First Development** - Achieving comprehensive test coverage
- **Constitution II: Documentation Standards** - Complete API documentation
- **Constitution III: Code Quality** - Type safety and style enforcement
- **Constitution IV: Security** - Security audit and validation
- **Constitution V: Behavioral Parity with Sqitch** - Regression protection and UAT compatibility testing

## Implementation Details

### UAT Compatibility Scripts

#### 1. Side-by-Side Test (`uat/side-by-side.py`)
**Status**: âœ… Implemented

Tests functional equivalence by running both tools in parallel:
- Runs each tutorial step with both sqitch and sqlitch
- Compares sanitized output (masks SHA1s, timestamps)
- Compares user-visible database state (ignores sqitch registry)
- Continues on failure with `--continue` flag
- Can ignore specific steps with `--ignore` flag
- Outputs comprehensive logs to `sqitch.log` and `sqlitch.log`

**Usage**:
```bash
./uat/side-by-side.py                    # Run full test
./uat/side-by-side.py --continue         # Continue on failures
./uat/side-by-side.py --out results.txt  # Save output to file
./uat/side-by-side.py --ignore 5 10      # Ignore steps 5 and 10
```

#### 2. Forward Compatibility Test (`uat/forward-compat.py`)
**Status**: ðŸ”² To Implement

Tests sqlitch â†’ sqitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqlitch
- Run step N+1 with sqitch
- Validate sqitch successfully continues from sqlitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps

**Key Validations**:
- Sqitch reads sqlitch registry correctly
- Sqitch handles sqlitch-deployed changes
- Sqitch verify works on sqlitch deployments
- Sqitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use same sanitization as side-by-side test
- Compare final database state after all steps
- Log both tools' operations for debugging
- Test with both tagged and untagged changes
- Validate plan file parsing compatibility

#### 3. Backward Compatibility Test (`uat/backward-compat.py`)
**Status**: ðŸ”² To Implement

Tests sqitch â†’ sqlitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqitch
- Run step N+1 with sqlitch
- Validate sqlitch successfully continues from sqitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps

**Key Validations**:
- Sqlitch reads sqitch registry correctly
- Sqlitch handles sqitch-deployed changes
- Sqlitch verify works on sqitch deployments
- Sqlitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use same sanitization as side-by-side test
- Compare final database state after all steps
- Log both tools' operations for debugging
- Test with both tagged and untagged changes
- Validate plan file parsing compatibility

#### Shared Infrastructure
All three scripts should share:
- Common sanitization functions (SHA1, timestamps)
- Database comparison utilities (user tables only)
- Logging and output formatting
- Test step definitions (from tutorial)
- Cleanup and error handling

**Directory Structure**:
```
uat/
  __init__.py              # Shared utilities
  side-by-side.py          # âœ… Implemented
  forward-compat.py        # ðŸ”² To implement
  backward-compat.py       # ðŸ”² To implement
  test_steps.py            # ðŸ”² Shared step definitions
  comparison.py            # ðŸ”² Shared comparison utilities
  sanitization.py          # ðŸ”² Shared sanitization functions
```

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Scope creep from "just one more feature"  
**Mitigation**: Strict no-new-features policy. Any feature requests get ticketed for post-lockdown.

**Risk**: Test coverage requirements delay release  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize high-value modules first. Allow exemptions with documented rationale.

**Risk**: Security issues found late in process  
**Mitigation**: Security audit early in lockdown phase.

**Risk**: Performance issues discovered  
**Mitigation**: Profile early. Most issues likely architectural, can be addressed post-1.0.

**Risk**: UAT scripts may have false positives from output formatting differences  
**Mitigation**: Sophisticated sanitization (timestamps, SHA1s). Document acceptable cosmetic differences. Focus on behavioral equivalence, not byte-for-byte output matching.

**Risk**: Compatibility testing may reveal deep architectural incompatibilities  
**Mitigation**: Run UAT tests early in lockdown phase. Registry format is already aligned with sqitch. Most compatibility issues should surface in side-by-side testing first.

**Risk**: Tutorial steps may change between sqitch versions  
**Mitigation**: Pin to specific sqitch version for UAT testing. Document which sqitch version UAT validates against. Update UAT when new sqitch versions are released.

**Priority**: HIGH - Prepare for stable 1.0 release  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks
