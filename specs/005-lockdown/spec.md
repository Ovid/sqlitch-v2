## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: Which environments must the new compatibility scripts exercise to count as "complete"? → A: Only the existing SQLite tutorial workflow
- Q: How should the three compatibility scripts integrate into our workflows once implemented? → A: Manual runs only (documented checklist)
- Q: Where must results from each manual UAT run be recorded? → A: Post a comment in the release pull request summarizing the outcomes

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- **NO new features** - Only bug fixes, tests, documentation, and stability improvements
- Achieve and maintain ≥90% test coverage across all modules
- All public APIs MUST have comprehensive docstrings
- All configuration behavior MUST be tested
- All error paths MUST be tested
- All CLI commands MUST have contract tests
- **UAT compatibility tests MUST pass** - Side-by-side, forward, and backward compatibility
- Security audit MUST pass
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate

### 🎯 Critical Principle: Sqitch Behavioral Parity
**All SQLitch behavior MUST align with Sqitch behavior as implemented in the vendored `sqitch/` directory.**

This means:
- When implementing or fixing features, **consult the Perl Sqitch codebase in `sqitch/`** as the source of truth
- Syntax and features that work in Sqitch (e.g., `@HEAD^`, `@ROOT`, symbolic references) MUST work identically in SQLitch
- Edge cases, error messages, and command-line option handling should mirror Sqitch's behavior
- When behavioral differences are discovered, SQLitch must be updated to match Sqitch (unless there's a documented security or correctness issue in Sqitch)
- All test scenarios should verify behavior against Sqitch's implementation, not assumptions

**Implementation Workflow**:
1. Before implementing any command or feature: Review corresponding Sqitch code in `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/` 
2. Document Sqitch's behavior (including edge cases, error paths, special syntax)
3. Implement SQLitch to match that behavior
4. Verify with UAT scripts and/or manual testing against actual Sqitch
5. Document any intentional deviations with clear rationale

This principle applies to ALL future work, not just lockdown tasks.

## Objectives

### 1. Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve ≥90% coverage in all modules
- **Type Safety**: Eliminate the current 70-error mypy backlog and keep `mypy --strict` green; add an automated guard (pytest or tox) that fails when mypy regresses.
- **Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public APIs
- **Code Style**: Enforce consistent formatting (Black, isort) and ensure linting (flake8) runs clean via an automated check.
- **Formatting Gates**: Add regression tests/automation that assert `black --check` and `isort --check-only` remain compliant.

### 2. Stability
- **Bug Fixes**: Address all known bugs and edge cases
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Test and handle boundary conditions
- **Regression Protection**: Ensure no regressions from features 001-004

### 3. Security
- **Input Validation**: Audit all user inputs for injection risks
- **File Operations**: Audit file handling for path traversal
- **Configuration**: Audit config parsing for security issues
- **Dependencies**: Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- **Hashing**: Update any Git-compatible SHA1 usage (e.g., `utils/identity.generate_change_id`) to pass Bandit by marking `usedforsecurity=False` while retaining Sqitch parity.

### 4. User Experience
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive --help output for all commands
- **Examples**: Add usage examples to documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

### 5. UAT Compatibility Testing
- **Scope**: All compatibility scripts validate the SQLite tutorial workflow only; other engines remain out of scope for lockdown.
- **Halt State Protocol**: UAT execution tasks follow an incremental debugging workflow. Each script failure triggers: HALT → identify root cause → implement minimal fix → run tests → commit → END SESSION. This prevents context overflow and ensures each fix is reviewed independently. See [`UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`](./UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) for detailed protocols.
- **Side-by-Side Testing**: `uat/side-by-side.py` validates functional equivalence between sqitch and sqlitch
  - Follows `sqitch/lib/sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod` tutorial steps
  - Compares command output (semantically equivalent, minor formatting differences acceptable)
  - Validates user-visible database state (ignores registry metadata)
  - Sanitizes timestamps and SHA1s for comparison
  - Halts on behavioral differences (not cosmetic output differences)
- **Forward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqlitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqitch as next command
  - Ensures sqlitch → sqitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqitch can continue from sqlitch state
  - Tests production scenario: users can switch to sqlitch without lock-in
- **Backward Compatibility Testing**: Script runs sqitch for each step, then validates compatibility by running sqlitch as next command
  - Ensures sqitch → sqlitch handoff works correctly
  - Validates that sqlitch can continue from sqitch state
  - Tests migration scenario: users can adopt sqlitch from existing sqitch projects
- **Execution Expectation**: All three scripts run as part of the documented release checklist; CI integration is optional.
- **Evidence**: Each manual run must be summarized in a comment on the release pull request with links to sanitized logs.

## Implementation Details

### UAT Compatibility Scripts

#### 1. Side-by-Side Test (`uat/side-by-side.py`)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Tests functional equivalence by running both tools in parallel:
- Runs each tutorial step with both sqitch and sqlitch
- Compares sanitized output (masks SHA1s, timestamps)
- Compares user-visible database state (ignores sqitch registry)
- Continues on failure with `--continue` flag
- Can ignore specific steps with `--ignore` flag
- Outputs comprehensive logs to `sqitch.log` and `sqlitch.log`

**Usage**:
```bash
./uat/side-by-side.py                    # Run full test
./uat/side-by-side.py --continue         # Continue on failures
./uat/side-by-side.py --out results.txt  # Save output to file
./uat/side-by-side.py --ignore 5 10      # Ignore steps 5 and 10
```

#### 2. Forward Compatibility Test (`uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`)
**Status**: ✅ Stub Implemented (full execution logic pending T060c-T060d)

Tests sqlitch → sqitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqlitch
- Run step N+1 with sqitch
- Validate sqitch successfully continues from sqlitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps

**Key Validations**:
- Sqitch reads sqlitch registry correctly
- Sqitch handles sqlitch-deployed changes
- Sqitch verify works on sqlitch deployments
- Sqitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use same sanitization as side-by-side test
- Compare final database state after all steps
- Log both tools' operations for debugging
- Test with both tagged and untagged changes
- Validate plan file parsing compatibility
- Document manual execution steps within the release checklist and developer guide.
- Record outcomes in the release pull request with links to relevant logs.

#### 3. Backward Compatibility Test (`uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`)
**Status**: ✅ Stub Implemented (full execution logic pending T060e-T060f)

Tests sqitch → sqlitch handoff:
- Run step N with sqitch
- Run step N+1 with sqlitch
- Validate sqlitch successfully continues from sqitch state
- Repeat for all tutorial steps

**Key Validations**:
- Sqlitch reads sqitch registry correctly
- Sqlitch handles sqitch-deployed changes
- Sqlitch verify works on sqitch deployments
- Sqlitch status shows correct state
- Database schema matches expectations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use same sanitization as side-by-side test
- Compare final database state after all steps
- Log both tools' operations for debugging
- Test with both tagged and untagged changes
- Validate plan file parsing compatibility
- Document manual execution steps within the release checklist and developer guide.
- Record outcomes in the release pull request with links to relevant logs.

#### Shared Infrastructure
All three scripts should share:
- Common sanitization functions (SHA1, timestamps)
- Database comparison utilities (user tables only)
- Logging and output formatting
- Test step definitions (from tutorial)
- Cleanup and error handling

**Directory Structure**:
```
uat/
  __init__.py                      # ✅ Shared package init
  side-by-side.py                  # ✅ Fully implemented
  sanitization.py                  # ✅ Implemented (extracted)
  comparison.py                    # ✅ Implemented (extracted)
  test_steps.py                    # ✅ Implemented (46 tutorial steps)
  scripts/
    forward-compat.py              # ✅ Stub (full logic pending)
    backward-compat.py             # ✅ Stub (full logic pending)
```

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Scope creep from "just one more feature"  
**Mitigation**: Strict no-new-features policy. Any feature requests get ticketed for post-lockdown.

**Risk**: Test coverage requirements delay release  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize high-value modules first. Allow exemptions with documented rationale.

**Risk**: Security issues found late in process  
**Mitigation**: Security audit early in lockdown phase.

**Risk**: UAT scripts may have false positives from output formatting differences  
**Mitigation**: Sophisticated sanitization (timestamps, SHA1s). Document acceptable cosmetic differences. Focus on behavioral equivalence, not byte-for-byte output matching.

**Risk**: Compatibility testing may reveal deep architectural incompatibilities  
**Mitigation**: Run UAT tests early in lockdown phase. Registry format is already aligned with sqitch. Most compatibility issues should surface in side-by-side testing first.

**Risk**: Tutorial steps may change between sqitch versions  
**Mitigation**: UAT testing validates against **Sqitch v1.5.3** (vendored in `sqitch/` directory). Update UAT scripts when upgrading to new Sqitch versions.
