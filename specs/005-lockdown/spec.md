# Feature Specification: Quality Lockdown and Stabilization

**Feature Branch**: `005-lockdown`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Prerequisites**: Feature 004 (Tutorial Parity) complete

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Review current codebase state and identify quality gaps
2. Run comprehensive test coverage analysis
3. Identify missing tests, documentation, and type hints
4. Fix remaining bugs and edge cases
5. Stabilize APIs and lock down interfaces
6. Enhance error messages and user experience
7. Perform security audit
8. Prepare for stable release
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- **NO new features** - Only bug fixes, tests, documentation, and stability improvements
- Achieve and maintain ≥90% test coverage across all modules
- All public APIs MUST have comprehensive docstrings
- All configuration behavior MUST be tested
- All error paths MUST be tested
- All CLI commands MUST have contract tests
- Security audit MUST pass
- Performance profiling MUST identify no critical bottlenecks
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate

---

## Objectives

### 1. Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve ≥90% coverage in all modules
- **Type Safety**: Add missing type hints, pass mypy --strict
- **Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all public APIs
- **Code Style**: Enforce consistent formatting (Black, isort)

### 2. Stability
- **Bug Fixes**: Address all known bugs and edge cases
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Test and handle boundary conditions
- **Regression Protection**: Ensure no regressions from features 001-004

### 3. Security
- **Input Validation**: Audit all user inputs for injection risks
- **File Operations**: Audit file handling for path traversal
- **Configuration**: Audit config parsing for security issues
- **Dependencies**: Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### 4. Performance
- **Profiling**: Profile common operations
- **Optimization**: Address performance bottlenecks
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and file handle usage
- **Scalability**: Test with large plan files and many changes

### 5. User Experience
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive --help output for all commands
- **Examples**: Add usage examples to documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

- [ ] Integration tests cover end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Regression tests prevent known bugs

### Security Gates
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities

- [ ] No command injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies have no critical CVEs
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents malicious inputs

### Performance Gates
- [ ] Common operations complete in <100ms
- [ ] Large plan files (1000+ changes) handle gracefully
- [ ] Memory usage stays under reasonable bounds
- [ ] No resource leaks detected

### Documentation Gates
- [ ] README complete with quickstart

## Non-Goals

- **New Features**: No new functionality added in this phase
- **API Changes**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Refactoring**: Only refactor if it improves quality/testability
- **Performance Optimization**: Only if critical issues found

---

## Constitutional Compliance

This feature directly supports:
- **Constitution I: Test-First Development** - Achieving comprehensive test coverage
- **Constitution II: Documentation Standards** - Complete API documentation
- **Constitution III: Code Quality** - Type safety and style enforcement
- **Constitution IV: Security** - Security audit and validation
- **Constitution V: Behavioral Parity with Sqitch** - Regression protection

---

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Scope creep from "just one more feature"  
**Mitigation**: Strict no-new-features policy. Any feature requests get ticketed for post-lockdown.

**Risk**: Test coverage requirements delay release  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize high-value modules first. Allow exemptions with documented rationale.

**Risk**: Security issues found late in process  
**Mitigation**: Security audit early in lockdown phase.

**Risk**: Performance issues discovered  
**Mitigation**: Profile early. Most issues likely architectural, can be addressed post-1.0.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10  
**Priority**: HIGH - Prepare for stable 1.0 release  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks
