# Implementation Session Report: 005-Lockdown (2025-10-11)

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Branch**: 005-lockdown
**Session Goal**: Execute implementation plan from tasks.md
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Critical feature gap identified

## Work Completed

### 1. Prerequisites Check ‚úÖ
- Ran prerequisite script to identify FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS
- Loaded all required context documents:
  - ‚úÖ tasks.md (complete task list)
  - ‚úÖ plan.md (architecture and tech stack)
  - ‚úÖ data-model.md (operational artifacts)
  - ‚úÖ research.md (baseline quality signals)
  - ‚úÖ quickstart.md (validation workflow)
  - ‚úÖ contracts/cli-uat-compatibility.md (UAT expectations)

### 2. Task Status Analysis ‚úÖ
- Reviewed all tasks in tasks.md
- Identified current execution point: **T060b** (UAT side-by-side execution)
- Previous phases complete:
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3.1: Setup & Baseline (T001-T005)
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3.2: Tests First (T010-T034)
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3.3: Implementation (T110-T119)
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3.4: Documentation (T040-T044)
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3.5: Security (T050-T051)
  - üîÑ Phase 3.6: Validation (T060a-T066) - In Progress

### 3. Critical Discovery üö®

**Identified Missing Feature**: Rework Support

While analyzing T060b (UAT side-by-side execution currently failing at step 42), I discovered the root cause is NOT a bug in symbolic reference resolution, but a **missing core feature**: support for reworked changes.

#### What Happened

**UAT Execution Timeline:**
- Steps 1-38: ‚úÖ Passing
- Step 39: `sqitch rework userflips` - Creates plan with duplicate change name
- Step 40: `sqlitch deploy` - **FAILS**: Cannot parse plan
- Steps 41-46: ‚ùå Blocked

**Root Cause:**
SQLitch's plan parser explicitly rejects duplicate change names:
```python
# sqlitch/plan/model.py:165
if entry.name in seen_names:
    raise ValueError(f"Plan contains duplicate change name: {entry.name}")
```

**Sqitch's Behavior:**
Sqitch **explicitly allows** duplicate change names via rework syntax:
```
userflips [userflips@v1.0.0-dev2] 2025-10-11... # Adds userflips.twitter
```

This is verified in `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm` which has logic to handle reworked changes.

#### Constitutional Impact

This is a **CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION** - a fundamental behavioral parity gap that violates our core principle:

> Sqitch Implementation as Source of Truth: All behavior must be verified against Sqitch's implementation in the `sqitch/` directory.

Rework is not an edge case - it's a **core Sqitch feature** demonstrated in the official tutorial.

### 4. Documentation Created ‚úÖ

Created comprehensive analysis and planning documents:

1. **REWORK_ANALYSIS.md** (49KB)
   - Executive summary of the blocking issue
   - Detailed Sqitch implementation analysis
   - Required implementation design
   - Phase-by-phase implementation strategy
   - Acceptance criteria and timeline estimates
   - Risk assessment

2. **Updated plan.md**
   - Added "Missing Rework Support" section
   - Documented constitutional violation
   - Listed blocking tasks
   - Marked as P1 CRITICAL priority

3. **Updated tasks.md**
   - Added **T067 [P1] CRITICAL**: Implement rework support
   - Updated T060b status to "BLOCKED"
   - Documented blocking relationship
   - Added detailed requirements from Sqitch behavior

## Tasks Modified

### T060b: Side-by-Side UAT Execution
**Status Changed**: IN PROGRESS ‚Üí BLOCKED

**Reason**: Cannot proceed past step 39 without rework support

**Updated Notes**:
- Root cause identified: Plan parser rejects duplicate change names
- Constitutional violation documented
- Dependency added: Must complete T067 first

### T067: Implement Rework Support (NEW)
**Priority**: P1 - CRITICAL
**Status**: Not Started
**Blocks**: T060b, T060c, T060d, T060e, T060f, T060g, T060h

**Scope**:
1. Remove duplicate name validation from Plan model
2. Add rework tracking fields to Change model
3. Update plan parser for rework syntax
4. Implement version resolution (latest/all)
5. Update deploy/revert commands
6. Add comprehensive test coverage

**Estimated Effort**: 7-11 hours

## Execution Protocol Followed

‚úÖ **Constitutional Verification**: Checked Sqitch implementation in `sqitch/` directory
‚úÖ **Source Truth Validation**: Reviewed `sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm` for rework logic
‚úÖ **Documentation First**: Created analysis before attempting fixes
‚úÖ **Halt on Discovery**: Stopped execution when constitutional violation found
‚úÖ **Task Creation**: Added T067 with full requirements and acceptance criteria

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required Before Continuing)

1. **Implement T067** - Rework Support
   - Phase 1: Model & Parser (Foundation)
   - Phase 2: Resolution (Navigation)
   - Phase 3: Commands (Behavior)
   - Phase 4: Validation (UAT)

2. **Verify with UAT**
   - Re-run side-by-side UAT from step 1
   - Ensure steps 1-46 all pass
   - Document any cosmetic differences

### After T067 Complete

3. **Resume T060b** - Complete side-by-side UAT
4. **Execute T060c-T060f** - Forward/backward compat scripts
5. **Complete T060g-T060h** - UAT review and PR evidence
6. **Finish T063** - Release collateral (manual)

## Dependencies Updated

**New Dependency Chain**:
```
T067 (rework support) 
  ‚îî‚îÄ> T060b (side-by-side UAT)
      ‚îî‚îÄ> T060c (implement forward-compat)
          ‚îî‚îÄ> T060d (execute forward-compat)
              ‚îî‚îÄ> T060e (implement backward-compat)
                  ‚îî‚îÄ> T060f (execute backward-compat)
                      ‚îî‚îÄ> T060g (review UAT logs)
                          ‚îî‚îÄ> T060h (prepare PR evidence)
```

## Quality Gates Status

### Coverage
- **Current**: 92% (from T062)
- **Target**: ‚â•90%
- **Status**: ‚úÖ PASSING

### Type Safety  
- **Tool**: mypy --strict
- **Status**: ‚úÖ PASSING (from T061)

### Security
- **Tools**: pip-audit, bandit
- **Status**: ‚úÖ PASSING (from T050-T051)

### UAT Validation
- **Side-by-side**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED at step 39 (needs T067)
- **Forward-compat**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not started
- **Backward-compat**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not started

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Systematic Analysis**: Following the UAT script step-by-step revealed the exact failure point
2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Checking the Sqitch source code provided definitive answers
3. **Constitutional Adherence**: Recognized this as a parity violation, not just a bug
4. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive analysis before attempting fixes

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Earlier Feature Verification**: Could have audited plan parser against Sqitch features before UAT
2. **Tutorial Pre-Analysis**: Could have identified rework requirement from tutorial review

### Process Validation
‚úÖ **Halt on Discovery**: Correctly stopped when constitutional violation found
‚úÖ **Document First**: Created analysis document before coding
‚úÖ **Task Planning**: Added proper task with acceptance criteria
‚úÖ **Dependency Management**: Updated blocking relationships

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Rework Implementation Complexity**: Medium-High
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive design document created
   - **Mitigation**: Phase-by-phase approach defined

2. **Breaking Changes**: Low
   - **Mitigation**: All changes are additive (new fields with defaults)
   - **Mitigation**: Existing plans without reworks unaffected

3. **Testing Burden**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Test strategy documented in REWORK_ANALYSIS.md
   - **Mitigation**: UAT provides integration validation

### Timeline Impact
- **Original Estimate**: 2-3 days remaining for lockdown
- **New Estimate**: +1-2 days for T067 implementation
- **Total Impact**: Moderate delay, but necessary for constitutional compliance

## Conclusion

This session successfully identified a **critical blocking issue** that prevents completion of the lockdown milestone. Rather than attempting a quick fix, I followed the constitutional protocol:

1. ‚úÖ Investigated the Sqitch source code
2. ‚úÖ Identified the behavioral gap
3. ‚úÖ Documented the constitutional violation
4. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive implementation plan
5. ‚úÖ Added proper task with dependencies
6. ‚úÖ Halted execution pending fix

The rework feature is **non-negotiable** for Sqitch parity. Without it, we cannot:
- ‚ùå Complete UAT validation (7 steps blocked)
- ‚ùå Claim behavioral parity with Sqitch
- ‚ùå Release v1.0 with integrity

**Recommendation**: Implement T067 immediately in the next session before proceeding with any other validation tasks.
