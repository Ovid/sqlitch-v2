## Constitutional Compliance

All implementation work followed the mandatory constitutional principles:

✅ **Sqitch Behavioral Verification**: All features verified against Perl Sqitch in `sqitch/` directory  
✅ **Test-First Development**: Failing tests preceded all implementations  
✅ **Observability & Determinism**: UAT scripts produce human-readable, sanitized outputs  
✅ **Behavioral Parity**: 46/46 tutorial steps match Sqitch behavior exactly  
✅ **Simplicity-First**: Reused existing helpers, avoided unnecessary complexity  
✅ **Documented Interfaces**: All public APIs have docstrings, guides updated

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Registry Path Issue (T060d Blocker)
**Problem**: SQLitch wrote absolute registry paths, preventing Sqitch interoperability  
**Solution**: Only write registry when explicitly provided via `--registry` option  
**Impact**: Unblocked forward/backward compatibility validation

### 2. Change ID Parity (T068)
**Problem**: SQLitch change IDs didn't match Sqitch (missing URI, incorrect @tag handling)  
**Solution**: Added URI parameter, preserved @tag suffixes in dependencies  
**Impact**: Achieved byte-for-byte change ID parity with Sqitch

### 3. Rework Support (T067)
**Problem**: Duplicate change names not supported  
**Solution**: Removed duplicate validation, added rework tracking, fixed dependency resolution  
**Impact**: Full tutorial workflow with rework now passes (steps 39-46)

### 4. Mypy Type Safety (T120a-T120aa)
**Problem**: 24 mypy --strict errors across codebase  
**Solution**: Fixed type annotations, added proper assertions, created TypedDicts  
**Impact**: 100% type safety compliance with regression protection

## UAT Evidence

All three compatibility scripts completed successfully:

### Side-by-Side Parity
- **Script**: `python uat/side-by-side.py`
- **Result**: 46/46 steps ✅
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/side-by-side.log`
- **Validation**: Database contents byte-identical

### Forward Compatibility
- **Script**: `python uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`
- **Result**: 46/46 steps ✅
- **Pattern**: SQLitch→Sqitch alternating execution
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/forward-compat-final.log`
- **Validation**: Sqitch can continue SQLitch workflows

### Backward Compatibility
- **Script**: `python uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`
- **Result**: 46/46 steps ✅
- **Pattern**: Sqitch→SQLitch alternating execution
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/backward-compat-final.log`
- **Validation**: SQLitch can continue Sqitch workflows

### Cosmetic Differences (Acceptable)
- Date format: Sqitch uses `+0200`, SQLitch uses fractional seconds
- Output verbosity: SQLitch provides explicit confirmations
- Tag display: Minor formatting differences
- **Data integrity**: Byte-identical across all tools
