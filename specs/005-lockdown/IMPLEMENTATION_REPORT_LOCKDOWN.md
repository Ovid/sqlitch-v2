# Implementation Report: Quality Lockdown and Stabilization

**Branch**: `005-lockdown`  
**Date**: 2025-10-11 (Updated)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Phase 3.1-3.6 Complete (UAT evidence captured, release collateral prepared)

---

## üÜï Latest Session Progress (2025-10-11)

### T060g: UAT Log Review ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-10-11 Updated)
- Reviewed sanitized outputs from `side-by-side.log`, `forward-compat-final.log`, and `backward-compat-final.log`.
- Confirmed all three harnesses exit with status code 0 and report "ALL TESTS PASSED" success banners.
- **CRITICAL RESOLUTION**: Fixed T060d blocker - SQLitch was writing absolute registry paths to target configurations, preventing Sqitch from resolving targets by name.
  - **Fix**: Modified `target_add` and `target_alter` to only write registry when explicitly provided via `--registry` option
  - **Result**: Both forward and backward compatibility tests now pass all 46 steps
  - **Validation**: Full Sqitch/SQLitch database interoperability achieved
- Verified database snapshots within each step remained byte-identical between Sqitch and SQLitch (no divergence markers).
- Catalogued cosmetic-only output differences:
  - **Date Format**: Sqitch uses `+0200` timezone, SQLitch uses fractional seconds `20:09:33.730`
  - **Output Verbosity**: SQLitch provides explicit confirmations (e.g., "Added target flipr_test"), Sqitch is silent on success
  - **Tag Display**: Sqitch shows `@v1.0.0-dev1 @v1.0.0-dev1` (duplicate), SQLitch shows `@v1.0.0-dev1` (once)
- **All cosmetic differences are acceptable** - they don't affect functionality or data integrity.
- Sanitization masked change IDs as `[REDACTED_CHANGE_ID]` and timestamps as `22:04:SS`, but SHA-1 computation parity confirmed through manual verification.

### T060d/T060f: Compatibility Test Execution ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Forward Compatibility** (`uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`):
- **Status**: ‚úÖ PASS - All 46 steps
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/forward-compat-final.log`
- **Pattern**: SQLitch‚ÜíSqitch alternating execution
- **Validation**: Sqitch can seamlessly continue workflows started by SQLitch

**Backward Compatibility** (`uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`):
- **Status**: ‚úÖ PASS - All 46 steps
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/backward-compat-final.log`
- **Pattern**: Sqitch‚ÜíSQLitch alternating execution
- **Validation**: SQLitch can seamlessly continue workflows started by Sqitch

### Critical Fix: Registry Path Issue (T060d Blocker)
**Problem**: SQLitch wrote absolute registry paths causing Sqitch to fail when reading targets.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```ini
# SQLitch was creating:
[target "flipr_test"]
uri = db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
registry = db:sqlite:/absolute/path/to/sqitch.db  # ‚Üê PROBLEM

# Sqitch expects:
[target "flipr_test"]
uri = db:sqlite:flipr_test.db
# No registry line - inferred automatically
```

**Solution**: Only write registry when explicitly provided via `--registry` option.

**Files Modified**:
- `sqlitch/cli/commands/target.py` - Removed automatic registry writing in `target_add` and `target_alter`
- `tests/cli/commands/test_target_functional.py` - Updated tests to verify registry NOT written by default

**Impact**: Unblocked T060d, T060e, T060f, enabling full forward/backward compatibility validation.

### T060h: Release PR Comment Preparation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Produced a ready-to-post comment template summarizing the three UAT runs with direct links to sanitized logs (see [Release Comment Template](#release-pr-comment-template)).
- Template follows the format documented in `quickstart.md` and includes slots for reviewer notes on cosmetic diffs.

### T063: Release Collateral ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Bumped project version to `1.0.0` in `pyproject.toml` and the editable install fallback within `sqlitch/__init__.py`.
- Authored `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/reports/v1.0.0-release-notes.md`, and `docs/reports/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md`, each referencing the captured UAT evidence.
- Documented known residual risks (pip CVE-2025-8869, outstanding `mypy --strict` warnings) and migration guidance for Sqitch users adopting SQLitch 1.0.0.

### Historical Note: T067 Rework Support Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Implement support for reworked changes (duplicate change names with different versions) per Sqitch behavior.

**Constitutional Requirement**: Sqitch allows reworked changes via syntax like `userflips [userflips@v1.0.0-dev2]` where the same change name appears multiple times in the plan with different tag dependencies.

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Model & Parser Foundation** ‚úÖ (Commit 5f2d7fe)
- Removed duplicate name validation from `Plan.__post_init__`
- Added `rework_of` field to `Change` model
- Implemented `is_rework()` and `get_rework_tag()` helper methods
- All 17 plan model tests passing

**Phase 2: Rework Command** ‚úÖ (Commit 745f8e0)
- Fixed rework command to append new entry instead of replacing
- Plan structure now matches Sqitch format exactly
- UAT Step 39 passing

**Phase 3: Deploy/Revert Logic** ‚úÖ (Commit 49ab330)
- **Problem**: Dependencies with tag references like `userflips@v1.0.0-dev2` couldn't be resolved
- **Root Cause**: Dependency validation and lookup used full string including `@tag` suffix
- **Solution**: Normalize dependency names by stripping tag suffix when checking deployment status
- **Changes**:
  1. Updated `_validate_dependencies()` to normalize dependency names
  2. Fixed `_assert_plan_dependencies_present()` to strip tag references
  3. Modified `_record_deployment_entries()` to look up by base name
- **Impact**: UAT steps 39-44 now passing (rework ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí verify ‚Üí revert)

#### UAT Results

**Steps 39-44 Status**: ‚úÖ ALL PASSING
- Step 39: Rework userflips change (adds twitter column)
- Step 40: Deploy reworked change
- Step 41: Verify deployment with SQLite schema dump
- Step 42: Revert reworked change back to @HEAD^
- Step 43: Verify revert with SQLite schema dump
- Step 44: Re-deploy final version

**Output Differences**: Cosmetic only (messaging format), database states match byte-for-byte

**Current Blocker**: Step 45 - Verify command has transaction nesting issue
- Error: "cannot start a transaction within a transaction"
- Note: This is a verify command issue, NOT a rework support issue
- Rework functionality is complete and working correctly

#### Constitutional Compliance ‚úÖ

This implementation followed the mandatory Sqitch verification protocol:
1. ‚úÖ Consulted Sqitch source code (`sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm`)
2. ‚úÖ Documented Sqitch's rework behavior (duplicate names, tag dependencies, `@HEAD` tracking)
3. ‚úÖ Implemented to match Sqitch's behavior exactly
4. ‚úÖ Verified against actual Sqitch via UAT script (steps 39-44)
5. ‚úÖ Documented behavior in code comments

**Task T067**: ‚úÖ MARKED COMPLETE

---

### UAT Script Validation (T060b, T060b2) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Execute `uat/side-by-side.py` against Sqitch v1.5.3 and confirm full tutorial parity before chaining the forward/backward harnesses.

**Outcome**: All 46 tutorial steps now pass for Sqitch and SQLitch across the side-by-side, forward, and backward compatibility scripts. Each run captured sanitized evidence in `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/` and concluded with success banners.

**Observed Output Variances** (cosmetic only):
- SQLitch emits acknowledgement lines for `config`, `target`, and `deploy` commands where Sqitch remains silent; functional state matches in every case.
- SQLitch deploy/status output includes absolute registry paths and ISO 8601 timestamps with fractional seconds, whereas Sqitch prints relative registry URIs and timezone-offset timestamps with dot padding.
- Verify summaries list the same changes but without Sqitch's alignment padding; tag-qualified entries still appear in step order.
- Revert messaging omits tag suffixes in the heading text while still manipulating the correct change instances (confirmed through database diffs and change ID parity).

**Historical Fixes Applied**:
1. **Step 30 Environment Reset** ‚Äî Adjusted UAT script cleanup to preserve `sqitch.conf` / `sqitch.plan`, aligning with tutorial prerequisites.
2. **Foreign Key Enforcement** ‚Äî Enabled `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` within SQLite engine workspace connections to match Sqitch cascade semantics (steps 22-24).
3. **Rework & Change ID Parity** ‚Äî Implemented duplicate change handling, dependency normalization, and SHA-1 parity (see [Historical Note: T067 Rework Support Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE](#historical-note-t067-rework-support-implementation--complete)).

With these fixes, forward (`python uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`) and backward (`python uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`) runs progressed without intervention, demonstrating bidirectional compatibility.

### Phase 3.3b: Mypy Type Safety - 100% Compliance Achieved ‚úÖ
**Status**: Complete (T120a-T120aa) ‚Äî 2025-10-12

**Achievement**: Successfully eliminated all 24 mypy --strict errors, achieving 100% type safety compliance.

**Starting Point**: 24 errors across 6 files (deploy, verify, status, help, rework, revert)

**Key Fixes Implemented**:
1. **Deploy Command (T120n-T120q)**: 
   - Created `DeployedMetadata` TypedDict to properly type metadata dictionaries containing `set[str]` tags
   - Added assertion for `registry_uri` (guaranteed non-None by `EngineTarget.__post_init__`)
   - Fixed target resolution to properly handle `dict.get()` return types with isinstance() checks
   
2. **CLI Commands (T120r-T120s)**:
   - Renamed shadowed `engine_target` variables in verify.py and status.py to avoid type confusion
   - Simplified status.py `_load_plan()` to call `parse_plan()` directly instead of using untyped kwargs
   - Added registry_uri assertions where EngineTarget guarantees non-None values
   
3. **Help Command (T120v-T120w)**:
   - Removed deprecated `click.BaseCommand` (Click 9.0 deprecation)
   - Switched to `click.Command` type with proper hasattr() checks for `get_command` method
   - Eliminated unnecessary type:ignore comments after proper typing
   
4. **Rework & Revert (T120x-T120y)**:
   - Added `normalize_path()` helper in rework.py to convert `Path | str | None` to `Path | None`
   - Added assertion in revert.py for symbolic reference resolution (guaranteed non-None in conditional)
   - Added explicit `target: str | None` type annotations to prevent inference errors

**Validation**:
- ‚úÖ `mypy --strict sqlitch/` reports "Success: no issues found in 53 source files"
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_type_safety.py::test_mypy_no_new_errors` passes
- ‚úÖ Updated `BASELINE_MYPY_ERROR_COUNT` from 24 to 0 in test suite

**Regression Protection**:
- Automated test enforces zero tolerance for new mypy errors
- Test fails if error count increases above baseline
- Forces developers to fix type issues rather than accumulate technical debt

**Impact**: This achievement establishes a high-quality foundation for future development, ensuring all code additions maintain strict type safety standards.

### Phase 3.4: Documentation & Guidance ‚úÖ
**Status**: Complete (T040-T044)

- ‚úÖ MEDIUM severity (SQL f-strings): Suppressed as false positive - schema names from validated config
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW severity (11 issues): Accepted - legitimate fallback handlers

**Configuration**:
- ‚úÖ `.bandit` configuration created with documented suppressions
- ‚úÖ `docs/SECURITY.md` documents all findings and rationale

## UAT Compatibility Results (SQLite Tutorial - All 46 Steps)

**Test Environment**: SQLite v3.x, Sqitch v1.5.3, SQLitch v1.0.0  
**Execution Date**: 2025-10-11

### ‚úÖ Side-by-Side Test
- **Status**: PASS - All 46 steps completed
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/side-by-side.log`
- **Validation**: Sqitch and SQLitch produce identical database state for parallel execution

### ‚úÖ Forward Compatibility Test  
- **Status**: PASS - All 46 steps completed
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/forward-compat-final.log`
- **Pattern**: SQLitch‚ÜíSqitch alternating execution
- **Validation**: Sqitch can seamlessly continue workflows started by SQLitch

### ‚úÖ Backward Compatibility Test
- **Status**: PASS - All 46 steps completed
- **Log**: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/backward-compat-final.log`
- **Pattern**: Sqitch‚ÜíSQLitch alternating execution
- **Validation**: SQLitch can seamlessly continue workflows started by Sqitch

### Cosmetic Differences (Non-Functional)

The following output differences are cosmetic only and do not affect functionality:

1. **Date Format**: Sqitch uses `+0200` timezone format, SQLitch uses fractional seconds
2. **Output Verbosity**: SQLitch provides explicit confirmations (e.g., "Added target flipr_test"), Sqitch is silent
3. **Tag Display**: Minor formatting differences in tag annotations

**Database Integrity**: All user tables (`users`, `flips`, `userflips`, `hashtags`) are byte-identical across tools.

### Critical Fix Applied

This release resolves a critical blocker that prevented Sqitch/SQLitch interoperability:
- **Issue**: SQLitch wrote absolute registry paths to target configurations
- **Impact**: Sqitch could not resolve targets by name (`sqitch verify` failed with "unable to open database file")
- **Fix**: Modified `target_add`/`target_alter` to omit registry unless explicitly provided via `--registry`
- **Result**: Full forward/backward compatibility achieved
