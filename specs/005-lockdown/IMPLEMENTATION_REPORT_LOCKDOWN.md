# Implementation Report: Quality Lockdown and Stabilization

**Branch**: `005-lockdown`  
**Date**: 2025-10-11 (Updated)  
**Status**: ✅ Phase 3.1-3.6 Complete (UAT evidence captured, release collateral prepared)

---

## 🆕 Latest Session Progress (2025-10-11)

### T060g: UAT Log Review ✅ COMPLETE
- Reviewed sanitized outputs from `side-by-side.log`, `forward-compat.log`, and `backward-compat.log`.
- Confirmed all three harnesses exit with status code 0 and report "ALL TESTS PASSED" or equivalent success banners.
- Verified database snapshots within each step remained byte-identical between Sqitch and SQLitch (no divergence markers were recorded in the logs).
- Catalogued cosmetic-only output differences:
  - SQLitch prints explicit confirmations for `config`, `target add`, and `deploy` operations where Sqitch is silent.
  - SQLitch deploy/status messaging includes absolute registry paths and ISO 8601 timestamps with fractional seconds instead of Sqitch's timezone-offset formatting.
  - Verify/status summaries omit Sqitch's dot-padding but enumerate the same change order, including tag-qualified rework entries.
  - Revert messaging elides explicit tag suffixes (e.g., "hashtags from flipr_test" vs. "hashtags @v1.0.0-dev2 from flipr_test"), while plan state and database contents remain in parity.
- Sanitization masked change IDs as `[REDACTED_CHANGE_ID]`, but SHA-1 computation parity was reconfirmed through internal diff markers — no mismatches detected.

### T060h: Release PR Comment Preparation ✅ COMPLETE
- Produced a ready-to-post comment template summarizing the three UAT runs with direct links to sanitized logs (see [Release Comment Template](#release-pr-comment-template)).
- Template follows the format documented in `quickstart.md` and includes slots for reviewer notes on cosmetic diffs.

### T063: Release Collateral ✅ COMPLETE
- Bumped project version to `1.0.0` in `pyproject.toml` and the editable install fallback within `sqlitch/__init__.py`.
- Authored `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/reports/v1.0.0-release-notes.md`, and `docs/reports/v1.0.0-migration-guide.md`, each referencing the captured UAT evidence.
- Documented known residual risks (pip CVE-2025-8869, outstanding `mypy --strict` warnings) and migration guidance for Sqitch users adopting SQLitch 1.0.0.

### Historical Note: T067 Rework Support Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Implement support for reworked changes (duplicate change names with different versions) per Sqitch behavior.

**Constitutional Requirement**: Sqitch allows reworked changes via syntax like `userflips [userflips@v1.0.0-dev2]` where the same change name appears multiple times in the plan with different tag dependencies.

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Model & Parser Foundation** ✅ (Commit 5f2d7fe)
- Removed duplicate name validation from `Plan.__post_init__`
- Added `rework_of` field to `Change` model
- Implemented `is_rework()` and `get_rework_tag()` helper methods
- All 17 plan model tests passing

**Phase 2: Rework Command** ✅ (Commit 745f8e0)
- Fixed rework command to append new entry instead of replacing
- Plan structure now matches Sqitch format exactly
- UAT Step 39 passing

**Phase 3: Deploy/Revert Logic** ✅ (Commit 49ab330)
- **Problem**: Dependencies with tag references like `userflips@v1.0.0-dev2` couldn't be resolved
- **Root Cause**: Dependency validation and lookup used full string including `@tag` suffix
- **Solution**: Normalize dependency names by stripping tag suffix when checking deployment status
- **Changes**:
  1. Updated `_validate_dependencies()` to normalize dependency names
  2. Fixed `_assert_plan_dependencies_present()` to strip tag references
  3. Modified `_record_deployment_entries()` to look up by base name
- **Impact**: UAT steps 39-44 now passing (rework → deploy → verify → revert)

#### UAT Results

**Steps 39-44 Status**: ✅ ALL PASSING
- Step 39: Rework userflips change (adds twitter column)
- Step 40: Deploy reworked change
- Step 41: Verify deployment with SQLite schema dump
- Step 42: Revert reworked change back to @HEAD^
- Step 43: Verify revert with SQLite schema dump
- Step 44: Re-deploy final version

**Output Differences**: Cosmetic only (messaging format), database states match byte-for-byte

**Current Blocker**: Step 45 - Verify command has transaction nesting issue
- Error: "cannot start a transaction within a transaction"
- Note: This is a verify command issue, NOT a rework support issue
- Rework functionality is complete and working correctly

#### Constitutional Compliance ✅

This implementation followed the mandatory Sqitch verification protocol:
1. ✅ Consulted Sqitch source code (`sqitch/lib/App/Sqitch/Plan.pm`)
2. ✅ Documented Sqitch's rework behavior (duplicate names, tag dependencies, `@HEAD` tracking)
3. ✅ Implemented to match Sqitch's behavior exactly
4. ✅ Verified against actual Sqitch via UAT script (steps 39-44)
5. ✅ Documented behavior in code comments

**Task T067**: ✅ MARKED COMPLETE

---

### UAT Script Validation (T060b, T060b2) ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Execute `uat/side-by-side.py` against Sqitch v1.5.3 and confirm full tutorial parity before chaining the forward/backward harnesses.

**Outcome**: All 46 tutorial steps now pass for Sqitch and SQLitch across the side-by-side, forward, and backward compatibility scripts. Each run captured sanitized evidence in `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/` and concluded with success banners.

**Observed Output Variances** (cosmetic only):
- SQLitch emits acknowledgement lines for `config`, `target`, and `deploy` commands where Sqitch remains silent; functional state matches in every case.
- SQLitch deploy/status output includes absolute registry paths and ISO 8601 timestamps with fractional seconds, whereas Sqitch prints relative registry URIs and timezone-offset timestamps with dot padding.
- Verify summaries list the same changes but without Sqitch's alignment padding; tag-qualified entries still appear in step order.
- Revert messaging omits tag suffixes in the heading text while still manipulating the correct change instances (confirmed through database diffs and change ID parity).

**Historical Fixes Applied**:
1. **Step 30 Environment Reset** — Adjusted UAT script cleanup to preserve `sqitch.conf` / `sqitch.plan`, aligning with tutorial prerequisites.
2. **Foreign Key Enforcement** — Enabled `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` within SQLite engine workspace connections to match Sqitch cascade semantics (steps 22-24).
3. **Rework & Change ID Parity** — Implemented duplicate change handling, dependency normalization, and SHA-1 parity (see [Historical Note: T067 Rework Support Implementation ✅ COMPLETE](#historical-note-t067-rework-support-implementation--complete)).

With these fixes, forward (`python uat/scripts/forward-compat.py`) and backward (`python uat/scripts/backward-compat.py`) runs progressed without intervention, demonstrating bidirectional compatibility.

---

## Constitutional Compliance

### ✅ Test-First Development
- All lockdown features started with failing tests (T010-T034)
- Implementation followed after test creation (T110-T119)

### ✅ Observability & Determinism
- UAT scripts use sanitized timestamps and SHA1s for reproducibility
- Structured logging maintains human-readable output

### ✅ Behavioral Parity
- All implementations follow `sqitchtutorial-sqlite.pod` specification
- No deviations from Sqitch behavior without documentation

### ✅ Simplicity-First
- Shared helpers extracted from `side-by-side.py` rather than rewritten
- Multi-engine support deferred to post-1.0

### ✅ Documented Interfaces
- All modules have docstrings (lockdown modules pydocstyle-compliant)
- README, CONTRIBUTING, and architecture docs updated
- API reference published

---

## Follow-Up Items

### Immediate (Pre-1.0 Release)
- All lockdown tasks (T001–T066) are complete. Proceed with tagging once reviewers acknowledge the UAT evidence and release collateral captured in this report.

### Post-1.0 Improvements
1. **mypy --strict compliance**: Address remaining 65 type errors in CLI commands
2. **pydocstyle full repo**: Fix D202 violations in non-lockdown modules
3. **pip 25.3 upgrade**: Resolve CVE-2025-8869 when upstream fix available
4. **Multi-engine UAT**: Extend compatibility scripts to MySQL/PostgreSQL
5. **CI automation**: Consider nightly UAT runs with flake detection
