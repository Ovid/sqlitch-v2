# T060 Task Breakdown - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Action**: Broke down T060 into 8 smaller, actionable tasks (T060a-T060h)

## What Was Done

### 1. Analyzed Current State
- Reviewed existing UAT scripts (`side-by-side.py`, `forward-compat.py`, `backward-compat.py`)
- Identified that forward/backward compatibility scripts are stubs that need implementation
- Confirmed all helper modules are in place and working
- Verified test suite is passing (1066 tests, 92% coverage)

### 2. Created Task Breakdown
Replaced single large task (T060) with 8 incremental tasks:

| Task | Description | Type | Estimated Time |
|------|-------------|------|----------------|
| T060a | Verify side-by-side.py prerequisites | Verification | 5-10 min |
| T060b | Execute side-by-side.py and fix failures | Execution | 15-30 min |
| T060c | Implement forward-compat.py logic | Implementation | 30-60 min |
| T060d | Execute forward-compat.py and fix failures | Execution | 15-30 min |
| T060e | Implement backward-compat.py logic | Implementation | 20-40 min |
| T060f | Execute backward-compat.py and fix failures | Execution | 15-30 min |
| T060g | Review all UAT logs for differences | Review | 20-30 min |
| T060h | Prepare release PR comment | Documentation | 10-15 min |

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours (spread across multiple sessions)

### 3. Updated Documentation

**Files Modified**:
1. ✅ `specs/005-lockdown/tasks.md`
   - Replaced T060 with T060a-T060h
   - Updated dependencies section with task sequencing

2. ✅ `specs/005-lockdown/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_LOCKDOWN.md`
   - Updated Phase 3.6 status
   - Changed completion percentage from 85% to 77% (51/66 tasks)
   - Added UAT task breakdown summary
   - Referenced UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

3. ✅ `specs/005-lockdown/SESSION_CONTINUITY.md`
   - Updated next priority tasks to reference UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
   - Simplified guidance to point to detailed plan

**Files Created**:
1. ✅ `specs/005-lockdown/UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
   - Detailed execution instructions for each task
   - Expected issues and remediation strategies
   - Commands to run for each task
   - Session continuity guidelines
   - Progress tracking checklist

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Incremental Progress**
- Each task can be completed in a single session
- Clear stopping points between tasks
- Easy to resume after interruptions

### 2. **Reduced Risk**
- Verify prerequisites before execution
- Fix issues incrementally rather than all at once
- Early detection of problems

### 3. **Better Debugging**
- Small scope makes it easier to identify issues
- Each task has documented expected issues
- Remediation strategies provided upfront

### 4. **Clear Dependencies**
- Sequential dependencies explicitly documented
- Can't proceed to implementation before prerequisites verified
- Forces validation at each step

### 5. **Session Continuity**
- Easy to see what was completed
- Clear next action at any point
- Progress tracking built in

## Task Dependencies (Sequential Flow)

```
T060a (verify prereqs)
  ↓
T060b (execute side-by-side)
  ↓
T060c (implement forward-compat)
  ↓
T060d (execute forward-compat)
  ↓
T060e (implement backward-compat)
  ↓
T060f (execute backward-compat)
  ↓
T060g (review all logs)
  ↓
T060h (prepare PR comment)
```

## Key Implementation Insights

### Current State Analysis

1. **side-by-side.py**: Fully implemented, uses shared helpers
2. **forward-compat.py**: Stub only, needs full implementation
3. **backward-compat.py**: Stub only, needs full implementation
4. **Helper modules**: All complete and working
   - `uat/sanitization.py`
   - `uat/comparison.py`
   - `uat/test_steps.py`

### What Each Script Needs to Do

**side-by-side.py** (already done):
- Run same tutorial steps with sqitch and sqlitch in parallel
- Compare outputs and database states
- Sanitize timestamps and SHA1s before comparison

**forward-compat.py** (needs implementation):
- Run tutorial steps with sqlitch FIRST
- Then validate sqitch can continue the workflow
- Verify sqitch accepts sqlitch's registry/state

**backward-compat.py** (needs implementation):
- Run tutorial steps with sqitch FIRST
- Then validate sqlitch can continue the workflow
- Verify sqlitch accepts sqitch's registry/state

### Expected Challenges

1. **sqitch Binary**: May not be installed (T060a will catch this)
2. **Registry Compatibility**: Forward/backward scripts test cross-tool compatibility
3. **Output Differences**: May need to enhance sanitization patterns
4. **Database State**: Need careful cleanup between runs

## Next Steps for Execution

1. **Start with T060a**: Verify prerequisites
   ```bash
   cd /Users/poecurt/projects/sqlitch
   source .venv/bin/activate
   which sqitch  # Check if sqitch is installed
   python uat/side-by-side.py --help  # Verify script works
   ```

2. **Follow UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md**: Each task has detailed instructions

3. **Mark Progress**: Update tasks.md as each task completes

4. **Commit Frequently**: After each task completion

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **Test-First Development**: Each UAT script has corresponding tests
✅ **Simplicity-First**: Reusing existing helpers, incremental approach
✅ **Observability**: Clear logging and evidence capture at each step
✅ **Documented Interfaces**: Detailed execution plan with expected outcomes

**Ready to Begin**: Yes, start with T060a following `UAT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
