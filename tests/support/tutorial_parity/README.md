# Tutorial Parity Fixtures

This directory provides sanitized fixtures for the SQLite tutorial scenarios.

* `sqitch.conf` mirrors the project configuration generated by Sqitch, omitting any
  `core.uri` entry and using four-space indentation so tests can diff the exact
  output written by SQLitch.
* `sqitch.plan` supplies a compact-format plan containing the initial tutorial
  changes and tags used in integration tests.
* `env_overrides.json` captures the environment variable precedence matrix that
  Scenario 10 exercises. Tests may load this file to apply deterministic
  overrides without depending on the developer's shell environment.
* `scripts/` contains deploy/verify templates with placeholder bodies that match
  Sqitch's defaults. They are deliberately minimal so tests can copy them into an
  isolated filesystem and customize as needed.

All files within this directory are free of secrets and hard-coded absolute
paths. Test cases should copy the fixtures into a temporary directory before
mutating them.
