# Test Isolation Migration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Branch**: 004-sqlitch-tutorial-parity  
**Issue**: Test pollution of user config files (CRITICAL bug)

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated **all 40 test files** from using Click's `isolated_filesystem()` directly to using the constitutional `isolated_test_context()` helper that provides proper environment isolation.

## Results

### Test Suite Status
- **Before Migration**: 995 tests total (973 passing before isolation work started)
- **After Migration**: 973 passed, 0 failed, 22 skipped
- **Migration-Related Failures**: 0 ✅
- **Success Rate**: 100% (of non-skipped tests)

### Files Migrated
- **Total**: 40 test files
- **Initial batch**: 2 files (CRITICAL fix in commit 39626d2)
- **Complete migration**: 38 files (commits d63d5f6, 0f70117)

### Enforcement Added
1. **Session-level enforcement** (`tests/conftest.py`):
   - Runs `git grep` before ANY test collection
   - Calls `pytest.exit(1)` if violations detected
   - Professional error message with fix instructions
   - Prevents accidental violations from entering codebase

2. **Test-level enforcement** (`tests/regression/test_test_isolation_enforcement.py`):
   - Regression test that catches violations
   - Clear error messages with file lists
   - Documents allowed exceptions

3. **Documentation** (`tests/regression/README_ENFORCEMENT.md`):
   - Comprehensive guide to enforcement mechanism
   - Migration patterns and examples
   - Constitutional references

## Issues Fixed During Migration

### 1. Working Directory Not Changing (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `isolated_test_context(runner, base_dir=tmp_path)` was setting environment variables but NOT changing the working directory to `tmp_path`.

**Root Cause**: Click's `isolated_filesystem(temp_dir=X)` has two effects:
- Creates/uses temporary directory
- **Changes working directory** to that directory

Our helper was only setting env vars when `base_dir` was provided, missing the directory change.

**Fix**: Wrap `runner.isolated_filesystem(temp_dir=base_dir)` around the env var setup:
```python
if base_dir is not None:
    with runner.isolated_filesystem(temp_dir=base_dir) as temp_dir_str:
        temp_dir = Path(temp_dir_str)
        # Set env vars AND change directory via Click
        yield runner, temp_dir
```

**Tests Fixed**: 29 tests (16 tag + 13 rework functional tests)

### 2. Filename Typos
**Problem**: Tests were writing to "sqlitch.conf" but environment variable pointed to "sqitch.conf"

**Files Affected**: `tests/cli/contracts/test_config_contract.py` (12 instances)

**Fix**: `sed -i '' 's/sqlitch\.conf/sqitch.conf/g'`

### 3. Variable Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Migration script changed context variable names (e.g., `tmp_dir` → `temp_dir`) but didn't update references in test bodies.

**Files Affected**: `tests/cli/contracts/test_target_contract.py` (1 instance)

**Fix**: Manual replacement of orphaned variable references

### 4. Environment Variable Conflicts (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `isolated_test_context()` was setting `SQLITCH_*` environment variables globally, which conflicted with tests that needed to set custom `SQLITCH_CONFIG_ROOT` or `SQITCH_CONFIG` values to test config resolution behavior.

**Root Cause**: When tests passed `env={"SQLITCH_CONFIG_ROOT": custom_path}` to `runner.invoke()`, the globally-set environment variables from `isolated_test_context()` were taking precedence, causing config commands to look in the wrong locations.

**Tests Affected**: 
- `test_config_user_scope_override` - Testing explicit `--user` scope
- `test_config_list_json_outputs_settings` - Testing config merging from multiple scopes
- `test_config_gets_default_value_from_explicit_scope` - Testing DEFAULT section lookups
- `test_explicit_scope_missing_option_errors` - Testing error messages
- `test_environment_override_workflow` - Testing `SQITCH_CONFIG` env var override

**Fix**: Added `set_env` parameter to `isolated_test_context()`:
```python
# For most tests (default behavior)
with isolated_test_context(runner) as (runner, temp_dir):
    # SQLITCH_* env vars are set automatically

# For tests needing custom environment handling
with isolated_test_context(runner, set_env=False) as (runner, temp_dir):
    # Only filesystem isolation, tests manage their own env vars
```

**Tests Fixed**: 4 tests + 1 related test (5 total)

## Pre-Existing Failures (Not Migration-Related)

**NONE** - All tests passing! ✅

The 4 tests that were initially failing were actually caused by the migration
itself (environment variable conflicts), not pre-existing issues. Once the
`set_env=False` parameter was added to `isolated_test_context()`, all tests passed.

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **FR-001b**: Environment isolation prevents config pollution  
✅ **Session Enforcement**: Violations blocked before test execution  
✅ **Test Coverage**: 100% of test files using constitutional helper  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive enforcement guide created

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Session enforcement (aborts before tests run)
python -m pytest tests/

# Test-level enforcement
python -m pytest tests/regression/test_test_isolation_enforcement.py

# Verify no direct usage
git grep -n 'isolated_filesystem()' tests/ | grep -v 'test_helpers.py' | grep -v 'conftest.py'

# Full test suite
python -m pytest tests/ --no-cov
# Expected: 973 passed, 22 skipped
```

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `tests/support/test_helpers.py` - Fixed `base_dir` working directory issue
- `tests/conftest.py` - Added session enforcement hook
- `tests/regression/test_test_isolation_enforcement.py` - Enhanced test-level enforcement
- `tests/regression/README_ENFORCEMENT.md` - NEW: Comprehensive documentation

### Migrated Test Files (38 total)
See commit history for complete list. Key categories:
- CLI command tests (add, config, deploy, init, revert, rework, tag, target, etc.)
- Integration tests (tutorial workflows, quickstart)
- Contract tests (config, target)
- Regression tests (tutorial parity)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Click's isolated_filesystem() does TWO things**: temp dir creation AND working directory change
2. **Session hooks fail fast**: `pytest_sessionstart()` prevents violations before any test runs
3. **Migration scripts have limits**: Can't reliably rename variables used in test bodies
4. **Typos hide in plain sight**: Configuration isolation exposed filename inconsistencies
5. **Triple-quoted strings win**: Error messages are far more readable as f"""...""" blocks
6. **Environment variable precedence matters**: Tests that need custom config paths require `set_env=False`
7. **Always verify assumptions**: The "pre-existing failures" turned out to be migration-caused issues

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Migration complete
2. ✅ All test isolation violations fixed
3. ✅ Enforcement mechanisms active
4. ✅ All tests passing (100% success rate)

**Migration Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Test Suite Health**: PERFECT (973/973 passing = 100%)  
**Constitutional Compliance**: 100%
