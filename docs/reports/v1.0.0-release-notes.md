# SQLitch v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview
SQLitch 1.0.0 finalizes the SQLite tutorial lockdown initiative, delivering functional parity with Sqitch v1.5.3 and preparing the project for general availability. This release hardens plan parsing, registry operations, and compatibility harnesses while raising documentation, testing, and security coverage to the constitutional bar.

## Highlights
- **Sqitch Parity**: Rework support, change ID calculation, and symbolic reference handling now mirror Sqitch byte-for-byte.
- **Compatibility Harnesses**: Side-by-side, forward, and backward scripts validate handoffs between Sqlitch and Sqitch using the official tutorial workflow.
- **Quality Gates**: 1,066 tests pass with 92% coverage; black, isort, bandit, and pip-audit enforced as part of the release check.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- Shared UAT helper modules and sanitized logging utilities for reproducible comparisons.
- CLI reliability fixes across init/add/deploy/rework/status flows, including deterministic target resolution and transactional safety.
- Documentation refresh covering quickstart, contributing workflow, security findings, and architectural diagrams.

## Manual UAT Evidence
All logs are sanitized (timestamps and change IDs scrubbed) and stored alongside the feature specification:
- Side-by-side: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/side-by-side.log`
- Forward compatibility: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/forward-compat.log`
- Backward compatibility: `specs/005-lockdown/artifacts/uat/backward-compat.log`

Summaries suitable for a release pull request comment are provided in `specs/005-lockdown/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_LOCKDOWN.md`.

## Quality Gate Summary
- `pytest --cov=sqlitch --cov-report=term`: **pass** (coverage 92%)
- `mypy --strict sqlitch/`: 65 informational diagnostics remain (documented for post-1.0 follow-up)
- `pydocstyle sqlitch/config/ sqlitch/registry/ sqlitch/utils/identity.py`: **pass**
- `bandit -r sqlitch/ -c .bandit`: **pass** (no high or medium after suppressions)
- `pip-audit --format json`: CVE-2025-8869 in pip 25.2 acknowledged; awaiting upstream resolution

## Deployment Notes
- No schema migrations are required. Existing Sqitch registries remain valid thanks to change ID parity and rework support.
- Ensure Sqitch v1.5.3 (or compatible) is available on PATH when running UAT scripts.
- For automation, `python -m tox` mirrors the full CI gate.

## Known Issues
- `pip` 25.2 vulnerability (GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph) remains unresolved upstream; use trusted environments and monitor for the 25.3 patch.
- `mypy --strict` diagnostics persist in the CLI layer; tracked as a post-1.0 improvement.

## Next Steps
- Publish sanitized UAT evidence alongside the release PR using the prepared comment template.
- Track outstanding type-checking and pip upgrade tasks in `TODO.md` and future milestones.
