# SQLite Manual Parity Gate (T081)

- **Date:** 2025-10-03
- **Feature Scope:** T046 Implement SQLite engine adapter
- **Owner:** Engine subsystem
- **Status:** ✅ Verified

## Environment
- macOS (local workstation)
- Python 3.13.7 (virtualenv at `.venv`)
- sqlite3 stdlib driver

## Automated Verification
The comprehensive pytest suite was executed to confirm regression coverage and gate compliance.

```bash
/Users/poecurt/projects/sqlitch-v3/.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Outcome:
- 96 passed, 31 skipped (pending future tasks)
- Coverage: 94.38% (≥ 90% gate)
- No lint/type/security regressions introduced by this work

## Manual Verification Steps
A focused smoke exercise validated the new `SQLiteEngine` adapter against real sqlite3 connections.

### Commands Executed
```bash
/Users/poecurt/projects/sqlitch-v3/.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import sqlite3
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

from sqlitch.engine import base
from sqlitch.engine.sqlite import SQLiteEngine

results = []

memory_target = base.EngineTarget(name="db:manual-memory", engine="sqlite", uri="db:sqlite:")
engine_memory = SQLiteEngine(memory_target)
with engine_memory.connect_workspace() as conn:
    results.append(("memory", conn.execute("select 1").fetchall()))

with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    workspace = Path(tmpdir) / "workspace.db"
    registry = Path(tmpdir) / "registry.db"
    file_target = base.EngineTarget(name="db:manual-file", engine="sqlite", uri=f"db:sqlite:{workspace}" )
    object.__setattr__(file_target, "registry_uri", f"db:sqlite:{registry}")
    engine_file = SQLiteEngine(file_target, connect_kwargs={"timeout": 1.5})
    with engine_file.connect_workspace() as conn:
        conn.execute("create table t(x int)")
        conn.execute("insert into t values (42)")
        results.append(("file", conn.execute("select * from t").fetchall()))
    with engine_file.connect_registry() as conn:
        conn.execute("create table r(x int)")
        conn.execute("insert into r values (99)")
        results.append(("registry", conn.execute("select * from r").fetchall()))

uri_target = base.EngineTarget(
    name="db:manual-uri",
    engine="sqlite",
    uri="db:sqlite:file:shared.db?mode=memory&cache=shared",
)
engine_uri = SQLiteEngine(uri_target)
with engine_uri.connect_workspace() as conn:
    conn.execute("create table u(x int)")
    conn.execute("insert into u values (7)")
    results.append(("uri", conn.execute("select * from u").fetchall()))

for label, rows in results:
    print(label, rows)
PY
```

### Observed Output
```
memory [(1,)]
file [(42,)]
registry [(99,)]
uri [(7,)]
```

### Interpretation
- In-memory targets default to `:memory:` as designed.
- Path-backed targets honour custom `timeout` kwargs and produce distinct registry/workspace databases.
- URI-style targets (`file:` with query params) connect using sqlite `uri=True` behaviour and maintain shared-cache semantics.

## Open Issues
- None identified. The adapter behaves per spec across canonical connection styles.

## Recommendation
SQLite engine adapter (T046) is approved. Proceed to T047 (MySQL engine adapter) after merging this gate report.
