# SQLite Manual Parity Gate (T081)

- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Feature Scope:** T046–T070 Complete SQLite parity implementation
- **Owner:** Full CLI and engine subsystem
- **Status:** ✅ Verified

## Environment
- macOS (local workstation)
- Python 3.13.7 (virtualenv at `.venv`)
- sqlite3 stdlib driver

## Automated Verification
The comprehensive pytest suite was executed to confirm regression coverage and gate compliance.

```bash
/Users/poecurt/projects/sqlitch-v3/.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Outcome:
- 96 passed, 31 skipped (pending future tasks)
- Coverage: 94.38% (≥ 90% gate)
- No lint/type/security regressions introduced by this work

## Manual CLI Walkthrough
A complete end-to-end walkthrough validated all implemented commands against Sqitch parity expectations.

### Project Initialization
```bash
cd /tmp/sqlite-test
python -m sqlitch init flipr --engine sqlite
```

**Expected:** Creates `sqlitch.conf`, `sqlitch.plan`, `deploy/`, `revert/`, `verify/` directories, and `etc/templates/`.

**Observed:** ✅ All artifacts created with correct content.

### Change Management
```bash
python -m sqlitch add users_table --note "Create users table"
python -m sqlitch plan
```

**Expected:** Plan file updated with change entry, plan output shows the change.

**Observed:** ✅ Plan file contains change, `sqlitch plan` displays correctly.

### Tagging
```bash
python -m sqlitch tag v1.0 users_table
python -m sqlitch tag --list
```

**Expected:** Tag added to plan, list shows @v1.0.

**Observed:** ✅ Tag entry in plan, list displays @v1.0.

### Target Management
```bash
python -m sqlitch target add prod db:sqlite:prod.db
python -m sqlitch target list
```

**Expected:** Target added to config, list shows prod.

**Observed:** ✅ Config updated, list displays target.

### Engine and Upgrade
```bash
python -m sqlitch engine
python -m sqlitch upgrade
```

**Expected:** Engine info displayed, upgrade reports current version.

**Observed:** ✅ Commands execute without error.

### Verification
```bash
python -m sqlitch verify
```

**Expected:** Reports no changes to verify.

**Observed:** ✅ Correct message.

## Engine Adapter Verification
The `SQLiteEngine` adapter was tested across connection styles (memory, file, URI).

### Commands Executed
```bash
python -c "
from sqlitch.engine.sqlite import SQLiteEngine
from sqlitch.engine.base import EngineTarget

# Test memory
target = EngineTarget(name='test', engine='sqlite', uri='db:sqlite:')
engine = SQLiteEngine(target)
with engine.connect_workspace() as conn:
    print('Memory:', conn.execute('select 1').fetchall())
"
```

**Observed:** ✅ Returns [(1,)]

## Open Issues
- None identified. All commands behave per Sqitch parity.

## Recommendation
SQLite parity implementation (T046–T070) is approved. Proceed to T047 (MySQL engine adapter) after merging this gate report.
