# SQLitch (Python Parity Fork)

> **Alpha software. Expect breaking changes.**
>
> This repository hosts the in-progress Python rewrite of Sqitch. The interfaces,
> registry schema bindings, and CLI surface are still under active development.
> Nothing here should be used in production environments yet.

## What is SQLitch?

SQLitch aims to deliver drop-in compatibility with the original Sqitch
Perl tooling while adopting a modern Python 3.11 stack. The end goal is to match
Sqitch command behavior, plan semantics, and registry schemas so existing teams
can migrate gradually without rewriting their workflows.

Key characteristics:

- Python 3.11 runtime with Click-based CLI scaffolding (under construction).
- Registry, plan, and configuration layers ported from Sqitch specs.
- Extensive parity test suites comparing SQLitch output to upstream Sqitch
  fixtures (many still skipped until the corresponding features land).
- Docker-based regression harness for MySQL and PostgreSQL parity once engines
  are implemented.

## Project Status

- âœ… Core domain models: plan parsing, configuration loader/resolver, registry state.
- âœ… Registry migrations mirror Sqitch SQL for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸš§ Engine adapters, CLI commands, and Docker orchestration are **not** ready.
- ðŸš§ Most integration tests remain skipped by design until their tasks are complete.

Follow the task tracker in `specs/001-we-re-going/tasks.md` for day-to-day
progress across milestones.

## Getting Started

> ðŸ’¡ Until command handlers and engines are wired up, SQLitch is primarily a
> domain-library and research sandbox. Expect many CLI commands to be stubs.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- (Optional) Docker, for future cross-engine parity tests

### Local Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Running the Test Suite

Tests enforce â‰¥90% coverage and fail when skip guards are violated.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest
```

### Code Quality Gates

This project mirrors Sqitchâ€™s zero-warning philosophy. Lint and type gates live
in `tox.ini`, and additional enforcement scripts are in `scripts/`.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tox
```

> Note: Some tox environments currently skip work-in-progress parity tests,
> as documented in the spec. Remove skips only when the corresponding feature
> is under active development.

## Repository Layout

- `sqlitch/` â€“ Python package containing domain models and (future) engine/CLI code.
- `tests/` â€“ pytest suites, including parity fixtures and tooling checks.
- `specs/` â€“ design documents, contracts, and milestone tracker.
- `sqitch/` â€“ vendored upstream Sqitch code used for parity validation.
- `scripts/` â€“ developer tooling, CI helpers, and Docker harness.
